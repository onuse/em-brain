Biologically Plausible Adaptation Configuration

Based on neuroscience research on real brain adaptation timescales:
- Synaptic plasticity: minutes to hours (hundreds of experiences)
- Network reorganization: days (thousands of experiences) 
- Parameter adaptation: gradual (1-2% changes)
- Stability: adaptation should be rare, not constant

This config makes Phase 2 adaptations much slower and more brain-like.

Biological Adaptation Timescales (Research References):

1. Synaptic Plasticity:
   - LTP/LTD: minutes to hours (Malenka & Bear, 2004)
   - Spike-timing dependent plasticity: 100s of pairings (Bi & Poo, 1998)
   
2. Network Reorganization:
   - Cortical map plasticity: days to weeks (Buonomano & Merzenich, 1998)
   - Hippocampal place cell remapping: hours (Leutgeb et al., 2005)
   
3. Learning Rate Adaptation:
   - Dopamine learning rate: hundreds of trials (Behrens et al., 2007)
   - Meta-learning: thousands of experiences (Wang et al., 2016)
   
4. Working Memory:
   - Prefrontal stability: minutes to hours (Goldman-Rakic, 1995)
   - Attention parameters: stable within tasks (Posner & Petersen, 1990)
   
Phase 2 current config (every 5 experiences, 10% changes) is ~100x too fast.
