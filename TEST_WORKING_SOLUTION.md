# Working Solution - Small Vision

## The Problem Was
- Trying to send 1.2MB messages through 16KB TCP buffers
- This is **impossible** without fragmentation
- All our "fixes" were band-aids

## The Real Solution
Use **64x48 resolution** (3,072 pixels):
- Total message: 12KB (fits in 16KB buffer!)  
- Can be sent atomically
- No fragmentation, no desync, no issues

## To Test

### Option A: Use small config
```bash
# On robot:
cd ~/em-brain/client_picarx
cp config/robot_config_small.json config/robot_config.json
python3 picarx_robot.py --brain-host <SERVER-IP>
```

### Option B: Override resolution
```bash
# On robot:
python3 picarx_robot.py --brain-host <SERVER-IP> --resolution 64 48
```

## Why This Works
- 12KB < 16KB buffer ✓
- Single atomic send ✓  
- No fragmentation ✓
- No timing issues ✓
- No protocol complexity ✓

## The Lesson
**Don't try to force huge messages through small pipes.**
Either:
1. Make messages smaller (what we did)
2. Make pipes bigger (system won't let us)
3. Use different protocol (UDP, WebRTC, etc.)

We wasted time on #2 and band-aids when #1 was the obvious solution.
