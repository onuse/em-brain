# Pragmatic Path Forward

## Current State: WORKING! ✅
- Using 64x48 vision (3,072 pixels)
- 12KB messages fit in 16KB TCP buffers
- No fragmentation, no timing issues
- **Robot and brain can communicate RIGHT NOW**

## Why This Works
Biology doesn't start with HD vision. Fruit flies navigate with 800 pixels per eye. Early mammals had blurry vision. **Low resolution is biologically authentic.**

## Migration Plan

### Phase 0: NOW (Already Working)
Keep using 64x48 on TCP. It works! The brain can learn from this.

### Phase 1: Add ONE UDP Sensor (Next Week)
Pick the simplest sensor (ultrasonic) and make it UDP:
```python
# Just blast UDP packets, don't care if they arrive
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sock.sendto(struct.pack('!If', timestamp, distance), (brain_ip, 10001))
```

If packets drop? Good! That's biological.

### Phase 2: Move Vision to UDP (When Ready)
Once UDP ultrasonic works, move vision:
- **GO FULL HD!** 1920x1080 or even 4K - UDP has no buffer limits!
- Lost frames? Brain learns to predict through gaps
- Jitter? Brain learns temporal patterns
- No more 64x48 compromise - that was just a TCP buffer workaround

### Phase 3: All Sensors UDP (Eventually)
- IMU at 100Hz UDP (vibrations visible!)
- Battery at 0.1Hz UDP (who cares if we miss one?)
- Only motor commands stay TCP (safety)

## The Philosophy

**Perfect is the enemy of good.**

Your 64x48 solution is GOOD. It works TODAY. The brain can learn from it NOW.

UDP streams are BETTER. But they can wait.

Biology evolved gradually. So should we.

## This Week's TODO

1. ✅ Use 64x48 resolution (DONE!)
2. Test robot with current working system
3. Watch brain learn from low-res vision
4. Maybe add UDP ultrasonic if bored

## Remember

- The fruit fly navigates with 800 pixels
- The earthworm has no eyes at all
- Your robot has 3,072 pixels and ultrasonics

**It's more than enough to start learning.**
