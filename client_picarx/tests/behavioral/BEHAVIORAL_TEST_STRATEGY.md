## Conclusion

This behavioral testing framework ensures the field-native intelligence system exhibits proper emergent behaviors while maintaining safety-critical functions. The tests verify that intelligence truly emerges from field dynamics rather than being programmed, creating an authentic artificial life-form with intrinsic motivations and self-directed learning.

Remember: **True intelligence emerges; it is not programmed.** The tests should reveal this emergence, not force it.
