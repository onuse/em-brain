# PiCar-X Brain Client Dependencies
# 
# Core dependencies for the brain client running on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 WH
# These are installed in addition to the SunFounder hardware libraries

# Core Python packages
numpy>=1.21.0               # Numerical computing (required for sensor data processing)
requests>=2.28.0            # HTTP client for brain server communication

# Optional but recommended
scipy>=1.9.0                # Scientific computing (for advanced sensor fusion)
pygame>=2.1.0               # Audio synthesis for vocal expressions (if using Mac audio mock)

# Development and debugging (comment out for production)
# matplotlib>=3.5.0         # Plotting for sensor data visualization  
# jupyter>=1.0.0            # Interactive development (if needed)

# Production logging and monitoring
# psutil>=5.9.0             # System monitoring and resource usage
# schedule>=1.2.0           # Task scheduling for periodic operations

# Notes:
# - SunFounder libraries (robot-hat, vilib, picar-x) are installed separately
# - I2S audio driver is installed via shell script
# - Keep dependencies minimal for Pi Zero performance
# - Uncomment optional packages as needed for specific features
