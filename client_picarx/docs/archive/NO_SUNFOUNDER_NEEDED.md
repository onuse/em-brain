# üéâ No SunFounder Libraries Required!

## We Control Hardware Directly

This implementation does **NOT** need any SunFounder software packages. We've achieved true bare-metal control using only standard Raspberry Pi interfaces.

### What We Don't Need
- ‚ùå `robot-hat` package from SunFounder
- ‚ùå `picarx` package from SunFounder
- ‚ùå `vilib` camera library
- ‚ùå `adafruit-circuitpython-servokit`
- ‚ùå Any other third-party motor/servo libraries

### What We Use Instead
- ‚úÖ **RPi.GPIO** - Pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS
- ‚úÖ **smbus** - Pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS  
- ‚úÖ **numpy** - Only for array operations (optional)

## How We Do It

### Servo Control
Instead of using SunFounder's servo abstractions, we write directly to PCA9685 registers via I2C:

```python
# Direct PCA9685 control via I2C
def set_servo_angle(angle_degrees):
    pulse_us = 1500 + (angle_degrees * 500/90)
    counts = int(pulse_us * 4096 / 20000)
    # Write to PCA9685 registers at address 0x40
    i2c_bus.write_byte_data(0x40, register, counts)
```

### Motor Control
Instead of SunFounder's motor library, we control motors directly:

```python
# Direct motor control
GPIO.output(23, GPIO.HIGH)  # Left motor direction
GPIO.output(24, GPIO.HIGH)  # Right motor direction
# PWM via PCA9685 channels 4 & 5
set_pwm_duty(4, 0.5)  # 50% speed left motor
set_pwm_duty(5, 0.5)  # 50% speed right motor
```

### Sensor Reading
Instead of SunFounder's sensor abstractions, we read I2C directly:

```python
# Direct ADC reading via I2C
def read_grayscale():
    # Read from ADC at address 0x14
    raw_value = i2c_bus.read_word_data(0x14, channel)
    return raw_value  # Raw 12-bit ADC value
```

## Installation is Trivial

On the Raspberry Pi, you only need to:

1. **Enable I2C** (via raspi-config)
2. **Install numpy** (optional): `sudo apt-get install python3-numpy`
3. **Deploy our code**: `bash deploy.sh`

That's it! No pip packages, no version conflicts, no dependency issues.

## Benefits

### 1. **Zero Dependencies**
No need to maintain SunFounder library compatibility or deal with version conflicts.

### 2. **Full Control**
We know exactly what every hardware command does at the register level.

### 3. **Portable**
Code works on any Raspberry Pi with I2C and GPIO - not tied to SunFounder's ecosystem.

### 4. **Educational**
Shows how servo control, PWM, and I2C actually work at the hardware level.

### 5. **Maintainable**
When something breaks, we can fix it ourselves without waiting for library updates.

## Verification

You can verify no SunFounder dependencies are needed:

```bash
# On Raspberry Pi, this will work without ANY pip installs:
cd ~/picarx_robot
sudo python3 picarx_robot.py --test

# Check what's actually imported:
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'src'); 
from hardware.bare_metal_hal import BareMetalHAL; 
print('Works with only standard libraries!')"
```

**This is true bare-metal programming** - direct hardware control with no abstractions between our code and the silicon!
