# Pattern-Based Attention: An Organic Approach

## Why Pattern-Based Attention is More Organic

### Biological Reality

In biological systems, attention doesn't work through coordinate systems and gradients:

1. **Pattern Recognition First**: Our brains detect salient patterns - faces, voices, movements - not "high gradient at position (x,y,z)"

2. **Surprise and Novelty**: Attention is captured by unexpected patterns, not mathematical derivatives

3. **Cross-Modal Binding**: We bind sights and sounds through temporal synchrony, not spatial coordinates

4. **Limited Resources**: Attention emerges from competition between patterns for limited processing capacity

### Current System vs Pattern-Based

#### Current (Gradient-Based):
```python
# Detects high gradients in spatial coordinates
gradients = compute_field_gradients(field)
attention_regions = find_high_gradient_regions(gradients)
focus_coordinates = get_peak_coordinates(attention_regions)
```

#### New (Pattern-Based):
```python
# Detects salient patterns regardless of location
patterns = extract_field_patterns(field)
salience = calculate_pattern_salience(patterns)  # novelty + surprise + importance
attention = select_most_salient_patterns(salience)
```

### Key Advantages

1. **No Coordinate Dependency**: Patterns are recognized by their intrinsic structure, not location

2. **Natural Salience**: Combines multiple factors that biological systems use:
   - **Novelty**: New patterns capture attention
   - **Surprise**: Unexpected patterns (violating predictions)
   - **Importance**: Learned or innate significance

3. **Temporal Dynamics**: Attention naturally shifts, maintains, or releases based on pattern evolution

4. **Cross-Modal Integration**: Patterns from different senses bind through synchrony, not spatial overlap

### Implementation Features

#### Pattern Extraction
- **Local patterns**: Sliding windows of different scales
- **Frequency patterns**: FFT-based rhythm and periodicity detection
- **Statistical patterns**: Mean, variance, entropy capture global properties

#### Salience Calculation
```
Salience = Novelty × 0.4 + Surprise × 0.3 + Importance × 0.3
```

- **Novelty**: How different from recent patterns?
- **Surprise**: How much does it violate expectations?
- **Importance**: Learned relevance + innate biases

#### Attention Dynamics
- **Focus**: Primary pattern + supporting patterns
- **Persistence**: Attention maintains on important patterns
- **Shifting**: Natural transitions based on salience changes
- **Capacity**: Limited slots (like biological working memory)

### Biological Inspirations

1. **Feature Detectors**: Like cortical columns responding to specific patterns
2. **Predictive Coding**: Surprise detection through expectation violation
3. **Biased Competition**: Patterns compete for limited attention
4. **Binding Problem**: Synchrony creates unified percepts

### Integration with Other Systems

Pattern-based attention naturally integrates with:

1. **Emergent Navigation**: Attend to place-defining patterns
2. **Pattern Motor**: Attention modulates motor responses
3. **Enhanced Dynamics**: Phase transitions affect attention state
4. **Memory Formation**: Attended patterns more likely to be remembered

### Example Scenarios

#### Visual Pop-Out
A red dot among green dots:
- Pattern: High contrast in color channel
- Salience: High novelty + moderate importance
- Result: Immediate attention capture

#### Rhythmic Entrainment
Repeating drum beat:
- Pattern: Periodic oscillation detected via FFT
- Salience: Low novelty but high importance (rhythm)
- Result: Sustained rhythmic attention

#### Cross-Modal Binding
Flash synchronized with beep:
- Pattern: Temporal correlation between modalities
- Salience: High surprise (unexpected correlation)
- Result: Bound audio-visual object

### Future Enhancements

1. **Learned Importance**: Patterns associated with rewards gain importance
2. **Top-Down Biasing**: Current goals bias pattern salience
3. **Attention Memories**: Remember which patterns were important when
4. **Predictive Attention**: Anticipate where important patterns will appear

## Conclusion

Pattern-based attention is fundamentally more organic because it operates on the same principles as biological attention systems. Instead of mathematical gradients in coordinate spaces, it uses pattern recognition, surprise detection, and competitive dynamics - the actual mechanisms of biological attention.

This approach not only eliminates coordinate dependencies but also creates richer, more adaptive behavior that emerges from the interaction of patterns, expectations, and limited resources - just like real brains.
