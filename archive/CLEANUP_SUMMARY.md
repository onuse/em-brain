# Cleanup Summary

## Major Changes

### 1. Archived Deprecated Files
Moved to `archive/deprecated_planning_system/`:
- `gpu_future_simulator.py`
- `gpu_future_simulator_deprecated.py` 
- `action_prediction_system.py`
- `cached_plan_system.py`

### 2. Renamed Core Files
- `simplified_unified_brain.py` → `unified_field_brain.py`
- `SimplifiedUnifiedBrain` → `UnifiedFieldBrain`
- `simplified_brain_factory.py` → `unified_brain_factory.py`
- `SimplifiedBrainFactory` → `UnifiedBrainFactory`
- `simplified_adapters.py` → `unified_adapters.py`
- `SimplifiedAdapterFactory` → `UnifiedAdapterFactory`

### 3. Removed Features
- All action prediction code
- All future simulation code
- All cached planning code
- SimulatedAction class and references
- Alternative implementation paths

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Class docstrings now reflect field-native approach
- No more references to "simplified" - it's the only implementation
- Clear naming that matches the architecture

## Architecture Now

```
UnifiedFieldBrain
├── Single 4D tensor field [D, H, W, C]
├── Field dynamics create all behavior
├── Strategic patterns shape gradients (channels 32-47)
└── Motor commands emerge from field gradients
```

## Key Principles
1. **One Path**: No alternative implementations or feature flags for different approaches
2. **Clear Names**: Files and classes named for what they are, not their history
3. **Field-Native**: Everything emerges from field dynamics, no symbolic intermediates

## What's Left
- Update imports in various test/analysis tools (low priority)
- These tools still work, just use old import paths

## Result
The codebase is now cleaner, more consistent, and truly reflects the field-native philosophy. There's one way to do things: through emergent field dynamics.
