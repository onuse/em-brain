# GPU Future Simulator Performance Analysis

## Current Performance (M1 Mac)
- **Base cycle time**: ~2100ms (without simulation)
- **With simulation**: ~7600ms (8 futures, 10 horizon)
- **Overhead**: ~5500ms per cycle
- **GPU utilization**: Should increase from 6% to ~30-40%

## Performance Breakdown

### Per Action Candidate (5 candidates):
- 8 futures per candidate = 40 total futures
- 10 timesteps per future = 400 field evolutions
- Field size: 32×32×32×64 = 2M elements
- Total operations: 800M per cycle

### Bottlenecks on M1:
1. **MPS limitations** - Metal Performance Shaders less optimized than CUDA
2. **Memory bandwidth** - Simulating 40 futures in parallel
3. **Python overhead** - Loop iterations in evaluate_candidates

## Expected Performance on RTX 5090

### Optimistic Projection:
- **CUDA advantage**: 5-10x faster tensor operations
- **Memory bandwidth**: 1008 GB/s vs 200 GB/s (5x)
- **Tensor cores**: Can use for convolutions
- **Expected cycle time**: 500-1000ms with simulation

### Realistic Projection:
- **With optimizations**: 200-500ms per cycle
- **32 futures, 20 horizon**: Still under 1 second
- **256 futures**: Possible in ~2-3 seconds

## Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Batch All Candidates Together
Instead of:
```python
for candidate in candidates:
    futures = simulate(candidate)
```

Do:
```python
all_futures = simulate_batch(all_candidates)
```

### 2. Reduce Field Resolution for Futures
- Use 16³×32 instead of 32³×64 for simulations
- Interpolate back to full resolution

### 3. Async Simulation
- Start simulating next cycle's futures during current cycle
- Hide latency behind CPU work

### 4. Learned Dynamics Model
- Replace analytical evolution with small neural network
- Much faster than convolutions

## Biological Interpretation

The 7-8 second "thinking time" is actually biologically plausible:
- Humans take 1-10 seconds for complex decisions
- The brain is literally simulating multiple futures
- Quality vs speed tradeoff is realistic

## Recommendations

### For Development (M1):
- Reduce to 4 futures, 5 horizon for faster testing
- Focus on quality of predictions, not quantity
- Use profiling to find specific bottlenecks

### For Deployment (RTX 5090):
- Scale up to 32-64 futures
- Implement batched operations
- Use TensorRT for optimization
- Consider mixed precision (FP16)

## Conclusion

The future simulator is working correctly but needs optimization for real-time performance. The overhead is acceptable for research but would benefit from GPU-specific optimizations for deployment.
