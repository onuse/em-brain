# Field-Native Strategic Planning

## The Realization

I was creating `AbstractGoal` and `StrategicPlan` classes - that's exactly the kind of symbolic engineering we're trying to avoid! Strategic planning should emerge from field dynamics, not be imposed on top.

## Field-Native Approach

### What is a "Strategy" in Field Terms?

A strategy is simply a **persistent field pattern** that biases future field evolution:

```python
# NOT THIS:
strategy = StrategicPlan(goals=["reach_light", "avoid_walls"])

# BUT THIS:
strategic_field_pattern = torch.Tensor([32, 32, 32, 64])
# A field configuration that, when held in memory channels,
# naturally biases motor outputs toward certain behaviors
```

### How Strategic Patterns Work

1. **Discovery Through Simulation**
   - GPU simulates field evolution
   - Identifies **attractor patterns** that lead to good outcomes
   - These patterns become "strategies"

2. **Natural Biasing**
   - Strategic patterns occupy the temporal/memory channels (32-47)
   - They create gradients that influence motor generation
   - No explicit "if goal then action" logic needed

3. **Emergent Behavior**
   - The field naturally flows along paths shaped by strategic patterns
   - Like water flowing downhill, behavior emerges from field topology

## Implementation Sketch

### Strategic Pattern Discovery
```python
class FieldStrategicPlanner:
    """Discovers persistent field patterns that guide behavior."""
    
    def discover_strategic_patterns(self, current_field, reward_history):
        """
        Use GPU to find field configurations that, when held in memory,
        lead to rewarding outcomes over extended periods.
        """
        # Not simulating action sequences, but field evolution patterns
        candidate_patterns = []
        
        for _ in range(self.n_candidates):
            # Create random perturbation in temporal channels
            memory_pattern = create_random_pattern(self.memory_channels)
            
            # Simulate field evolution WITH this pattern held constant
            future_field = self.simulate_with_memory_bias(
                current_field, 
                memory_pattern,
                horizon=100  # Long horizon
            )
            
            # Evaluate: does this pattern lead to good field states?
            pattern_value = self.evaluate_field_trajectory(future_field, reward_history)
            
            candidate_patterns.append((memory_pattern, pattern_value))
        
        # Return pattern that creates best long-term field evolution
        return max(candidate_patterns, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
```

### Natural Execution
```python
def process_with_strategy(self, sensory_input):
    """
    Process sensory input with strategic bias from persistent patterns.
    """
    # Integrate sensory input normally
    self.unified_field = self.integrate_sensory(sensory_input)
    
    # Strategic patterns in memory channels create natural bias
    # No explicit "execution" needed - the field evolution IS the execution
    self.unified_field = self.evolve_field(self.unified_field)
    
    # Motor output emerges from biased field
    motor_output = self.extract_motor_from_field(self.unified_field)
    
    return motor_output
```

### Key Differences from Engineered Approach

| Engineered | Field-Native |
|------------|--------------|
| Explicit goals | Attractor patterns |
| If-then rules | Field gradients |
| Discrete strategies | Continuous field configurations |
| Symbolic execution | Natural dynamics |

## Biological Analogy

This is like how the brain's **default mode network** creates persistent activity patterns that bias behavior:
- Not explicit plans but neural configurations
- Create "grooves" that guide activity flow
- Strategies are embodied in the network state itself

## The Deep Insight

**"Strategy" is not something you have, it's something you ARE.**

The strategic pattern doesn't tell the field what to do - it changes what the field IS, and behavior naturally follows.

## Concrete Example: Light-Seeking

Instead of:
```python
goal = "increase brightness"
if brightness < target:
    move_forward()
```

We have:
```python
# A field pattern discovered through simulation that,
# when present in channels 32-47, creates gradients
# that naturally cause forward movement when brightness is low
light_seeking_pattern = discovered_patterns["light_affinity"]

# Install pattern in memory channels
unified_field[:, :, :, 32:48] += light_seeking_pattern * 0.3

# Normal field evolution now naturally seeks light
# No explicit logic needed
```

## Why This Is Better

1. **Truly emergent** - Strategies arise from field dynamics
2. **Continuous** - No discrete state transitions
3. **Robust** - Patterns create tendencies, not rigid rules
4. **Learnable** - Can discover new strategies through experience
5. **Field-native** - Uses same 4D tensor mechanics throughout

## Next Steps

1. Identify which field channels should hold strategic patterns
2. Design pattern discovery through simulation
3. Test how persistent patterns influence behavior
4. Observe emergent strategies without engineering them

The GPU "deep think" becomes a search for beneficial field configurations, not action sequences. It's discovering the shape of thoughts that lead to good outcomes.
