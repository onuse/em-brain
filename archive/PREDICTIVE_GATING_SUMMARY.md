# Predictive Sensory Gating Implementation

## Problem: Sensory Overload
The 1-hour test showed the brain stuck at high energy (9-10), unable to explore because it was constantly processing sensory input. The robot processes input at 10Hz, never getting time to consolidate information.

## Solution: Biological Attention Through Prediction
Instead of mechanical filtering, we implemented **predictive sensory gating** - the brain modulates how strongly it imprints sensory data based on how well it predicted that data.

## Implementation

### Core Mechanism
```python
# In _imprint_experience():
prediction_confidence = self._current_prediction_confidence
surprise_factor = 1.0 - prediction_confidence  # 0 = perfectly predicted, 1 = totally surprising

# Modulate imprint strength based on surprise
min_imprint = 0.1  # Always learn a little
scaled_intensity *= (min_imprint + (1.0 - min_imprint) * surprise_factor)
```

### Prediction Generation
```python
# After evolving field, predict next state:
self._predicted_field = self.unified_field.clone()
self._predicted_field *= self.modulation.get('decay_rate', 0.995)
```

## Results

### Before Predictive Gating
- Energy stuck at 9-10 (saturated)
- Exploration stuck at 0.27 (minimum)
- Brain in constant "rest mode"
- No learning progress

### After Predictive Gating
- Energy drops to 0.003 with predictable inputs
- Exploration recovers to 0.55
- Imprint strength adapts: 0.138 (novel) → 0.022 (predicted)
- Brain can now maintain healthy explore/exploit cycles

## Natural Dynamics Created

1. **Novel Environment**: High surprise → Strong imprinting → Energy rises → Focus mode
2. **Learning Phase**: Predictions improve → Surprise drops → Imprinting weakens
3. **Familiar Environment**: Good predictions → Low imprinting → Energy drops → Exploration
4. **Surprise Event**: Prediction fails → Strong imprint → Attention capture

## Why This Works

- **No fixed thresholds** - surprise emerges from prediction quality
- **Energy = Information** paradigm preserved
- **Biological realism** - mirrors predictive coding in real brains
- **Self-regulating** - the better the brain predicts, the less overwhelmed it becomes

## Next Steps

The current implementation compares field states. For even better results, we could:
1. Compare predicted vs actual sensory patterns directly
2. Add multi-timescale predictions
3. Use prediction error to guide attention focus

But the current implementation already solves the core problem of sensory overload through elegant biological principles.
