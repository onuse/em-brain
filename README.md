# Field-Native Intelligence System

Research implementation of continuous multi-dimensional field dynamics as an alternative to discrete pattern-based AI approaches.

See docs/ folder for technical documentation:
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture and field organization
- **TODO.md** - Pending tasks and implementation status

## Quick Start

### Installation & Test
```bash
pip install numpy torch psutil  # Core dependencies
python3 tests/integration/test_installation.py

# Run demos
python3 demo.py  # Interactive launcher
python3 tools/runners/demo_runner.py spatial_learning

```

**Requirements:** Python 3.8+, 4GB+ RAM, CPU/GPU

## Core Approach

This project implements continuous field dynamics as an alternative to discrete AI. Intelligence emerges from the topology and evolution of a continuous multi-dimensional field.

### Architectural Evolution
- **4D Tensor Architecture**: Simple [32,32,32,64] tensor for GPU optimization
- **Performance**: ~250ms cycle time with GPU acceleration
- **Evolved Field Dynamics**: Self-modifying evolution rules encoded in the field
- **Working Memory**: Temporal persistence through differential decay rates
- **Topology Regions**: Abstraction formation and causal relationship tracking
- **Consolidation System**: Pattern replay and dream states during idle
- **True Emergence**: No semantic structure in tensors - all properties emerge

### ðŸš€ Project goal: Fully Emergent Brain
The brain features complete emergence with:
- **Self-Modifying Dynamics**: Evolution rules encoded in the field itself
- **Emergent Sensory Mapping**: Patterns find natural locations through resonance
- **True Autonomy**: System determines how to learn
- **Open-Ended Evolution**: No ceiling on complexity
- **Meta-Learning**: Field improves its own learning
- **No Fixed Architecture**: Everything emerges from field dynamics

### Field Organization (Simplified)
- **4D Unified Field**: Simple tensor where all properties emerge
- **No Semantic Encoding**: Properties like spatial, temporal, oscillatory emerge naturally
- **GPU Optimized**: Works efficiently on CUDA, MPS, and CPU
- **Larger Capacity**: 2M elements for richer dynamics

### Key Features
- **Pattern-Based Processing**: All cognition through pattern recognition, no fixed coordinates
- **Self-Organization**: Constraint discovery and enforcement guide field evolution
- **Spontaneous Dynamics**: Autonomous field activity without sensory input
- **Blended Reality**: Confidence-based mixing of internal simulation with sensory data
- **Cross-Session Learning**: Persistence system maintains brain state across runs

## Architecture Overview

### Dynamic Brain Creation
1. Robot connects with sensor/actuator specifications
2. System calculates optimal field dimensions (logarithmic scaling)
3. Brain created with dimensions matching robot complexity
4. Adapters translate between robot and brain spaces

### Cognitive Systems

#### Evolved Field Dynamics
- **Self-Modifying**: Evolution rules encoded in the field itself
- **Energy & Confidence**: Emerge from field state, not fixed parameters
- **Spontaneous Activity**: Traveling waves with learned parameters
- **Working Memory**: Temporal persistence through differential decay
- **Meta-Learning**: System improves its learning over time

#### Pattern-Based Intelligence
- **Unified Pattern System**: Shared extraction for motor and attention
- **Motor Generation**: Field patterns â†’ motor commands via motor cortex
- **Attention**: Pattern salience (novelty + surprise + importance)
- **No coordinates**: All processing through pattern matching

#### Self-Organizing Dynamics
- **Topology Regions**: Stable patterns form persistent structures
- **Causal Tracking**: Temporal sequences create relationships
- **Abstraction Formation**: Regions compose into concepts
- **Reward Topology**: Goals emerge from field deformations

#### Autonomous Behavior
- **Predictive Actions**: Imagine outcomes before acting
- **Exploration Drive**: Emerges from low energy + high novelty
- **Dream States**: Consolidation and pattern replay during idle
- **No fixed modes**: Continuous energy/confidence dynamics

#### Navigation and Memory
- **Emergent Places**: Stable field configurations, not coordinates
- **Field Tension**: Navigation through field state differences
- **Topology Memory**: Persistent patterns in field structure
- **Experience Integration**: Reward-modulated memory formation

## Implementation Status
