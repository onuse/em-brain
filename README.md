**Requirements:** Python 3.8+, 4GB+ RAM, GPU recommended for field dynamics

## üß† Core Philosophy

**Core Approach:** Intelligence emerges from **continuous field dynamics** in multi-dimensional space, implemented alongside discrete pattern storage approaches. After implementing constraint-based discrete intelligence, we developed field-native continuous intelligence as an alternative approach.

### The Field Intelligence Approach
**Field-based implementation** - position determines meaning, topology enables reasoning. This provides an alternative to discrete pattern-based approaches.

### Technical Implementation
- **Field-Native Intelligence** - Cognition emerges from unified 36D field dynamics
- **Physics-Based Organization** - Dimensions organized by dynamics families (oscillatory, flow, topology, energy, coupling, emergence) rather than sensory modalities
- **Emergent Capabilities** - Creative reasoning, analogical thinking, hierarchical abstraction, temporal intelligence
- **Substrate Independence** - Field patterns work independently of biological implementation details

### Technical Achievements
- Implemented paradigm transition from discrete to continuous intelligence
- Complete field-native brain implementation with biological optimizations  
- Demonstrated creative combination, analogical reasoning, and temporal intelligence
- Production-ready field brain deployable via configuration

**Technical Innovation:** Field topology serves as the intelligence substrate where concepts, memories, and reasoning emerge from continuous constraint interactions.

## üî¨ Scientific Foundation

This research extends foundational discoveries to test constraint necessity:

### Constraint-Based Intelligence Theory
- **Free Energy Principle** (Friston): Intelligence emerges from prediction error minimization under energy constraints
- **Embodied Cognition** (Varela): Physical constraints are not limitations but enablers of intelligence
- **Sparse Coding** (Olshausen): Resource scarcity (2% activation) creates efficient representations

### Emergence Science
- **Complex Systems Theory**: Simple constraint interactions create complex behaviors
- **Phase Transitions**: Intelligence may be a phase transition that occurs under specific constraint densities
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Intelligence as emergent optimization under multiple competing constraints

### Experimental Evidence
- **Biological Case Study**: Evolution discovered intelligence through constraint-driven selection pressure
- **Artificial Failures**: Most AI lacks intelligence because it lacks necessary constraint interactions
- **Photon Paradox**: Unlimited computational resources (photons) produce zero intelligence
