# Run demos
python3 demo.py  # Interactive launcher

**Requirements:** Python 3.8+, 4GB+ RAM, CPU/GPU

## Core Approach

This project implements continuous field dynamics as an alternative to discrete AI. Intelligence emerges from the topology and evolution of a continuous multi-dimensional field.

### Recent Major Improvements
- **Simplified to 4D Tensor**: From complex 11D to simple [32,32,32,64] tensor
- **2.2x Performance Gain**: GPU acceleration now possible (~183ms optimized)
- **Unified Systems**: Energy + confidence + spontaneous dynamics in one system
- **Working Memory**: Temporal persistence through differential decay rates
- **Topology Regions**: Abstraction formation and causal relationship tracking
- **Consolidation System**: Pattern replay and dream states during idle
- **True Emergence**: No semantic structure in tensors - all properties emerge

### ðŸš€ Latest Achievement: Fully Emergent Brain
The brain now features complete emergence with:
- **Self-Modifying Dynamics**: Evolution rules encoded in the field itself
- **Emergent Sensory Mapping**: Patterns find natural locations through resonance
- **True Autonomy**: System determines how to learn
- **Open-Ended Evolution**: No ceiling on complexity
- **Meta-Learning**: Field improves its own learning
- **No Fixed Architecture**: Everything emerges from field dynamics

### Field Organization (Simplified)
- **4D Unified Field**: Simple tensor where all properties emerge
- **No Semantic Encoding**: Properties like spatial, temporal, oscillatory emerge naturally
- **GPU Optimized**: Works efficiently on CUDA, MPS, and CPU
- **Larger Capacity**: 2M elements for richer dynamics

### Key Features
- **Pattern-Based Processing**: All cognition through pattern recognition, no fixed coordinates
- **Self-Organization**: Constraint discovery and enforcement guide field evolution
- **Spontaneous Dynamics**: Autonomous field activity without sensory input
- **Blended Reality**: Confidence-based mixing of internal simulation with sensory data
- **Cross-Session Learning**: Persistence system maintains brain state across runs

## Architecture Overview

### Dynamic Brain Creation
1. Robot connects with sensor/actuator specifications
2. System calculates optimal field dimensions (logarithmic scaling)
3. Brain created with dimensions matching robot complexity
4. Adapters translate between robot and brain spaces

### Cognitive Systems

#### Evolved Field Dynamics
- **Self-Modifying**: Evolution rules encoded in the field itself
- **Energy & Confidence**: Emerge from field state, not fixed parameters
- **Spontaneous Activity**: Traveling waves with learned parameters
- **Working Memory**: Temporal persistence through differential decay
- **Meta-Learning**: System improves its learning over time

#### Pattern-Based Intelligence
- **Unified Pattern System**: Shared extraction for motor and attention
- **Motor Generation**: Field patterns â†’ motor commands via motor cortex
- **Attention**: Pattern salience (novelty + surprise + importance)
- **No coordinates**: All processing through pattern matching

#### Self-Organizing Dynamics
- **Topology Regions**: Stable patterns form persistent structures
- **Causal Tracking**: Temporal sequences create relationships
- **Abstraction Formation**: Regions compose into concepts
- **Reward Topology**: Goals emerge from field deformations

#### Autonomous Behavior
- **Predictive Actions**: Imagine outcomes before acting
- **Exploration Drive**: Emerges from low energy + high novelty
- **Dream States**: Consolidation and pattern replay during idle
- **No fixed modes**: Continuous energy/confidence dynamics

#### Navigation and Memory
- **Emergent Places**: Stable field configurations, not coordinates
- **Field Tension**: Navigation through field state differences
- **Topology Memory**: Persistent patterns in field structure
- **Experience Integration**: Reward-modulated memory formation

## Implementation Status

### Fully Integrated Features
- Simplified 4D tensor architecture with GPU acceleration
- Evolved field dynamics (self-modifying evolution rules)
- Working memory through temporal persistence
- Topology regions for abstraction and memory
- Consolidation system with dreams and replay
- Predictive action selection (imagine before acting)
- Reward topology shaping (emergent goal-seeking)
- Pattern-based motor and attention (coordinate-free)
- Persistence for cross-session learning

### Recently Removed (Simplifications)
- Enhanced Dynamics â†’ Replaced by unified field dynamics
- Developmental Confidence â†’ Exploration emerges from energy
- Cognitive Autopilot â†’ Continuous dynamics instead of modes
- Coordinate systems â†’ Pure pattern-based processing
- 11D tensor architecture â†’ 4D GPU-optimized tensor

### Known Limitations
- Large persistence files (100+ MB) without compression
- SimplifiedUnifiedBrain not yet integrated everywhere
- Hardware deployment interface requires updating
