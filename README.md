# Emergent Robot Brain

> *A world-agnostic emergent intelligence system that develops memory, goals, and behavior through experience*

## 🧠 Philosophy

This project explores **emergent intelligence** - the idea that complex, intelligent behavior can arise from simple, interacting systems without explicit programming. Rather than hand-coding behaviors, this brain learns to understand its world and develop goals through direct experience.

### Core Principles

**🌱 Emergent Memory**  
Memory phenomena emerge naturally from neural-like dynamics - no special "memory classes" needed. The system develops working memory, long-term consolidation, associative recall, and natural forgetting through simple connection strengthening and spreading activation.

**🎯 Motivation-Driven Behavior**  
Multiple competing motivators (survival, curiosity, exploration) generate goals and actions dynamically. The robot develops its own objectives based on its experiences and current state, not predetermined scripts.

**🌍 World-Agnostic Design**  
The brain makes no assumptions about its environment. It learns sensory dimensions, discovers actuator effects, and adapts to any simulation or real-world setup automatically.

**🔄 Lifelong Learning**  
Persistent memory enables true lifelong learning. Each session builds on previous experiences, creating increasingly sophisticated behavior over time.

**⚡ High-Performance Architecture**  
Optimized for real-time operation with parallel processing, GPU acceleration, and efficient memory management. Capable of 70+ FPS prediction rates.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

### The Experience Graph (World Graph)
```
[Experience] ←→ [Experience] ←→ [Experience]
     ↑              ↑              ↑
Temporal        Similarity    Strength-based
 Links         Connections    Associations
```

Every interaction creates an **Experience Node** containing:
- Mental context (what the robot perceived)
- Action taken (what the robot did)  
- Outcome (what actually happened)
- Prediction error (how wrong the robot was)

Experiences connect through **neural-like dynamics**:
- **Temporal links** create episodic memory chains
- **Similarity connections** enable associative recall
- **Spreading activation** makes related memories accessible
- **Natural decay** causes unused memories to fade

### Multi-Motivator System
```
Survival Motivator ──┐
Curiosity Motivator ─┼── Action Selection ── Motor Commands
Exploration Motivator─┘
```

**Competing motivators** evaluate situations and propose actions:
- **Survival Motivator**: Seeks food, avoids damage, maintains health
- **Curiosity Motivator**: Explores surprising or unpredictable areas  
- **Exploration Motivator**: Maps unknown territories and discovers new experiences

The motivation system **dynamically generates goals** based on:
- Current robot state (health, energy, position)
- Recent experiences and prediction errors
- Motivator-specific evaluation of environmental opportunities

### Prediction Pipeline
```
Current State → Experience Traversal → Motivator Evaluation → Action → Outcome
                      ↓                     ↓              ↓
                 Memory Recall      Goal Generation    Experience
                 Pattern Matching   Action Candidates  Creation
```

1. **Graph Traversal**: Parallel search through experience memory to find relevant past situations
2. **Motivator Evaluation**: Multiple motivators assess the situation and propose action candidates  
3. **Consensus Resolution**: Best action selected based on motivator priorities and confidence
4. **Execution**: Action performed and outcome observed
5. **Learning**: New experience created and integrated into memory graph

### Adaptive Systems

**🎛️ Parameter Tuning**  
System automatically adjusts exploration rates, memory consolidation frequency, and time budgets based on prediction accuracy and environmental complexity.

**🔍 Actuator Discovery**  
Brain learns motor effects by observing correlations between commands and sensory changes, developing emergent categories (spatial, manipulative, environmental).

**💾 Persistent Memory**  
Cross-session learning through compressed graph storage, allowing the robot to build increasingly sophisticated behavior over multiple lifetimes.

**⚙️ Configuration Management**  
Centralized settings system with configurable memory paths, GPU preferences, and system parameters through `settings.json`.
