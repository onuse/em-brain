# Brain Assumptions to Validate

Before running long experiments, we need to validate our core assumptions about how the brain should operate. These assumptions form the foundation of our approach.

## **Core Architecture Assumptions**

### **1. 4-System Emergence Hypothesis**
**Assumption**: Intelligence emerges from interaction of 4 systems: experience storage, similarity search, activation dynamics, and prediction engine.

**Validation Needed**:
- [ ] **Component isolation tests** - Test each system independently
- [ ] **Interaction tests** - Verify systems work better together than alone
- [ ] **Performance scaling** - Measure intelligence vs. experience data size
- [ ] **Comparison baselines** - Compare to simpler architectures (random, simple RL)

### **2. Similarity-Based Intelligence**
**Assumption**: Similar situations should produce similar actions, and this creates intelligent behavior.

**Validation Needed**:
- [ ] **Similarity consistency** - Same inputs should find same neighbors
- [ ] **Similarity quality** - Neighbors should be behaviorally relevant
- [ ] **Generalization test** - Similar situations should transfer learning
- [ ] **Robustness test** - Small input changes shouldn't break similarity

### **3. Activation Dynamics Memory**
**Assumption**: Spreading activation creates working memory effects that improve prediction.

**Validation Needed**:
- [ ] **Activation persistence** - Recently accessed experiences stay "hot"
- [ ] **Activation spreading** - Related experiences get activated together
- [ ] **Memory effects** - Activation improves prediction accuracy
- [ ] **Decay dynamics** - Natural decay creates appropriate forgetting

## **Embodied Free Energy Assumptions**

### **4. Free Energy Minimization**
**Assumption**: Action selection through embodied Free Energy minimization creates natural preferences without hardcoded motivations.

**Validation Needed**:
- [ ] **Energy-seeking behavior** - Low battery should drive charging behavior
- [ ] **Thermal regulation** - Hot motors should reduce activity
- [ ] **Cognitive load** - High memory pressure should simplify actions
- [ ] **State transitions** - Different hardware states should create different behaviors

### **5. Embodied Priors**
**Assumption**: Physical constraints create natural priors that shape behavior appropriately.

**Validation Needed**:
- [ ] **Prior activation** - Hardware state should modulate prediction precision
- [ ] **Prior balance** - Multiple priors should integrate appropriately
- [ ] **Prior learning** - Priors should adapt based on experience
- [ ] **Prior robustness** - System should handle prior conflicts gracefully

## **Learning Assumptions**

### **6. Prediction Error Learning**
**Assumption**: Minimizing prediction error drives learning and improvement.

**Validation Needed**:
- [ ] **Error reduction** - Prediction error should decrease over time
- [ ] **Error correlation** - Lower error should correlate with better performance
- [ ] **Error-driven adaptation** - High error should drive exploration
- [ ] **Error plateaus** - Learning should stabilize when error is minimized

### **7. Experience-Based Improvement**
**Assumption**: More experience should lead to better performance.

**Validation Needed**:
- [ ] **Experience scaling** - Performance should improve with more data
- [ ] **Experience quality** - Diverse experiences should outperform repetitive ones
- [ ] **Experience interference** - New experiences shouldn't catastrophically forget old ones
- [ ] **Experience transfer** - Similar experiences should accelerate learning

## **Biological Realism Assumptions**

### **8. Gradual Learning**
**Assumption**: Learning should be gradual and continuous, not sudden jumps.

**Validation Needed**:
- [ ] **Learning curves** - Smooth improvement over time
- [ ] **No sudden jumps** - Avoid unrealistic performance spikes
- [ ] **Plateau behavior** - Learning should level off appropriately
- [ ] **Forgetting curves** - Memory decay should follow biological patterns

### **9. Consolidation Benefits**
**Assumption**: Rest periods should strengthen memory and improve performance.

**Validation Needed**:
- [ ] **Consolidation improvement** - Performance should improve after rest
- [ ] **Memory strengthening** - Consolidated memories should be more stable
- [ ] **Interference reduction** - Consolidation should reduce memory interference
- [ ] **Optimal timing** - There should be optimal consolidation intervals

## **Environmental Assumptions**

### **10. Sensory-Motor Coordination**
**Assumption**: 16D sensory input should provide sufficient information for 4D action output.

**Validation Needed**:
- [ ] **Input sufficiency** - 16D input should enable goal achievement
- [ ] **Output adequacy** - 4D actions should cover behavioral repertoire
- [ ] **Coordination emergence** - Sensory-motor coordination should develop naturally
- [ ] **Adaptation robustness** - System should handle sensory/motor changes

### **11. Environment Complexity**
**Assumption**: Our sensory-motor world provides appropriate challenge level.

**Validation Needed**:
- [ ] **Learnable complexity** - Environment should be neither too easy nor impossible
- [ ] **Behavioral diversity** - Environment should support multiple strategies
- [ ] **Skill development** - Environment should enable progressive skill building
- [ ] **Transfer potential** - Skills should transfer to variations

## **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Micro-Experiments (1-2 days)**
Test each assumption with focused 5-10 minute experiments:
- Single assumption per experiment
- Clear pass/fail criteria
- Minimal computational requirements
- Immediate feedback

### **Phase 2: Integration Tests (2-3 days)**
Test assumption interactions:
- Multiple assumptions per experiment
- System-level emergent behaviors
- Longer time horizons (30-60 minutes)
- Performance trajectory analysis

### **Phase 3: Validation Experiments (1 week)**
Comprehensive validation with proper controls:
- Statistical rigor (multiple seeds, confidence intervals)
- Control conditions (random baselines, ablation studies)
- Biological realism metrics
- Publication-quality analysis

## **Success Criteria**

### **Minimum Viable Validation**
- [ ] 8/11 core assumptions validated
- [ ] No major assumption failures
- [ ] Basic learning demonstrated
- [ ] System stability confirmed

### **Scientific Validation**
- [ ] 10/11 assumptions validated with statistics
- [ ] Biological realism confirmed
- [ ] Multiple environment generalization
- [ ] Comparison to baselines

### **Deployment Readiness**
- [ ] All assumptions validated
- [ ] Robust performance across conditions
- [ ] Predictable failure modes
- [ ] Maintenance and debugging protocols
