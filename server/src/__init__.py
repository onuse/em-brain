Organized Brain Architecture

A constraint-based artificial brain with modular architecture:
- Vector streams for core intelligence (sensory, motor, temporal)
- Attention systems for selective focus and binding
- Memory systems for pattern storage and retrieval
- Parameter systems for emergent constraint-based behavior
- Maintenance systems for system health and optimization

Everything emerges from hardware constraints and biological principles.
