Sketch: Parallel Sensor Processing Architecture

Each sensor gets its own processing thread that directly
injects into specific regions of the field. No synchronization
needed because the field itself handles integration.

This is speculative - for future exploration!

ANALYSIS: Synchronization Tradeoffs

1. FULL PARALLEL (One thread per sensor):
   Pros: 
   - True parallel processing
   - Each sensor at natural rate
   - Most biological
   
   Cons:
   - Race conditions on field writes
   - Need locks (kills performance) or accept conflicts
   - Hard to debug

2. SINGLE WRITER (Queue-based):
   Pros:
   - No synchronization issues
   - Clean, predictable
   - Easy to debug
   
   Cons:
   - Adds latency (queuing)
   - Less biological
   - Writer thread is bottleneck

3. BIOLOGICAL (Accept conflicts):
   Pros:
   - Most realistic
   - No synchronization overhead
   - Conflicts become "neural noise"
   
   Cons:
   - Non-deterministic
   - Hard to debug
   - May need careful tuning

RECOMMENDATION:
Start with current approach (async buffers, single brain thread).
If we need more parallelism later, go BIOLOGICAL - let conflicts
happen and treat them as neural noise. The field dynamics should
naturally integrate conflicting inputs, just like real brains do!
