# Dynamic Dimensions Implementation Summary

## Implementation Complete ✅

The pragmatic dynamic dimension system (Plan B) has been successfully implemented. The system provides true dynamic adaptation to robot complexity while maintaining implementation simplicity.

## What Was Built

### 1. DynamicDimensionCalculator
- Calculates conceptual dimensions using logarithmic scaling: `log₂(sensors) × complexity_factor`
- Distributes dimensions across physics families (spatial, oscillatory, flow, etc.)
- Selects appropriate tensor configurations based on robot complexity
- Creates mapping between conceptual and tensor dimensions

### 2. Dynamic Brain Architecture
- **Conceptual dimensions**: Adapt to robot complexity (18D-57D range)
- **Tensor dimensions**: Fixed 11D structure with variable resolution
- **Memory usage**: Scales appropriately (0.1MB to 95MB)

### 3. Preset Tensor Configurations
- Small robots (<20D): Minimal tensor with 0.1MB memory
- Medium robots (20-40D): Balanced tensor with 5.3MB memory  
- Large robots (40-60D): Rich tensor with 94.9MB memory
- XLarge robots (>60D): Maximum tensor with 94.9MB memory

## Key Benefits

1. **True dynamic adaptation**: Robots get brain complexity matching their capabilities
2. **Manageable memory**: Preset tensors keep memory usage reasonable
3. **Clean implementation**: No hacky workarounds, clear separation of concerns
4. **Backward compatible**: Existing UnifiedFieldBrain still works for legacy code

## Usage

Enable dynamic brains in configuration:
```json
{
  "use_dynamic_brain": true,
  "complexity_factor": 6.0
}
```

Create brain with robot profile:
```python
brain = factory.create(
    field_dimensions=None,  # Not used in dynamic mode
    spatial_resolution=4,
    sensory_dim=24,        # Robot sensors
    motor_dim=4            # Robot actuators
)
```

## Next Steps

The dynamic dimension system is ready for use. Future enhancements could include:
- Custom tensor configurations for specific robot types
- Adaptive tensor reshaping during runtime
- Dimension importance weighting

The implementation successfully balances dynamic adaptation with practical constraints.
