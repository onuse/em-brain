# Constraint System Archive

## Reason for Archival
The constraint discovery and enforcement system was removed because:

1. **Redundant functionality** - Field decay, diffusion, enhanced dynamics, and maintenance already provide superior self-organization
2. **Mechanical behavior** - System mechanically rediscovered same spatial constraints repeatedly 
3. **Minimal impact** - Constraint forces were tiny (0.1 * strength) and had negligible effect on field behavior
4. **Performance overhead** - Gradient calculations and constraint checking added computational cost without benefit
5. **Code complexity** - Isolated system with separate memory/history disconnected from brain intelligence

## Archived Files
- `constraint_field_nd.py` - Main constraint system implementation
- `__init__.py` - Module initialization

## Removed from Brain
- Constraint field initialization and storage
- Periodic constraint discovery (every 5 cycles)
- Constraint force application to unified field
- Constraint-related telemetry and brain state fields
- `_discover_field_constraints()` method

## Impact
- Eliminated "üîç Discovered 3 new constraints" spam
- Reduced computational overhead
- Simplified brain architecture
- No meaningful change to field behavior or intelligence

The brain's existing dynamics provide better self-organization without the constraint system overhead.
