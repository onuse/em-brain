Emergent Attention Allocation System

Implements constraint-based attention allocation where streams compete for limited
attention resources based on their current state, urgency, and processing needs.

Key principles:
- Attention emerges from resource competition, not explicit programming
- Streams bid for attention based on activation strength and constraint pressures
- Winner-take-all dynamics with biological realism
- Dynamic allocation based on real-time system state
