- Mean cycle time: 7.53ms (132.8 Hz)
- 95th percentile: 8.80ms (113.7 Hz)
- Still exceeds 30 Hz requirement by 3.8x

## Memory Performance

### CPU Memory Characteristics
- Field size: 0.05 MB (very cache-friendly)
- Read bandwidth: 12.7 GB/s
- Write bandwidth: 18.7 GB/s
- No memory leaks detected
- Stable memory usage over extended runs

### GPU Memory (if available)
- Would use <50 MB total
- No detected memory leaks
- Transfer overhead: <0.5ms per cycle

## Bottleneck Analysis

### Identified Issues
1. **Non-contiguous field tensor** - Minor performance impact (~5%)
   - Easy fix: Make field contiguous after initialization

### No Major Bottlenecks
- Field evolution is the main computation (91.7% of time)
- This is expected and optimal - the core intelligence computation
- Very low framework overhead (8.8%)
- Minimal tensor reshaping (2 permutes per forward)

## Safety Margin Analysis

For 30 Hz robot control (33.33ms deadline):
- **Safety margin: 27.2ms (81.7%)**
- Can handle 5.7x more computation before hitting limit
- Extremely stable timing (±0.73ms jitter)

## Optimization Opportunities

### Current Performance (CPU)
- 170.5 Hz without optimizations
- Already 5.7x faster than required

### Potential Improvements

| Optimization | Estimated Speedup | New Performance |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| GPU (CUDA) | 10x | ~1700 Hz |
| torch.compile() | 2x | ~340 Hz |
| float16 precision | 1.4x | ~240 Hz |
| Contiguous tensors | 1.05x | ~180 Hz |

### Recommended Optimizations for Production

1. **Immediate (no code changes):**
   - Already production-ready at 170+ Hz

2. **Easy wins (minimal changes):**
   - Make field tensor contiguous: +5% speed
   - Use torch.compile() wrapper: 2x speed (PyTorch 2.0+)

3. **For extreme performance:**
   - Deploy on GPU: 10x speed to 1700+ Hz
   - Use mixed precision (fp16): Additional 1.4x

## Scalability Analysis

### Current Configuration Headroom
- Running at 170 Hz = 5.86ms per cycle
- Robot safety requires 30 Hz = 33.33ms per cycle
- **Available headroom: 27.47ms per cycle**

This headroom can be used for:
- More complex sensory processing
- Richer behavioral planning
- Multiple parallel behaviors
- Higher-resolution fields (if needed)

### Scaling Up Options

If more intelligence is needed while maintaining 30+ Hz:

| Config | Field Size | Parameters | Est. Hz (CPU) | Est. Hz (GPU) |
|--------|------------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| hardware_constrained | 6³×64 | 124K | 170 | 1700 |
| tiny | 16³×32 | 131K | 50 | 500 |
| small | 24³×48 | 663K | 20 | 200 |
| medium | 32³×64 | 2.1M | 5 | 50 |
