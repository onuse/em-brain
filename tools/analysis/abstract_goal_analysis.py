print("   Not: 'Go to coordinates (5.2, 7.8)'")
print("   But: 'Find food', 'Return home', 'Explore new areas'")
print("   Or:  'Go where it was warm', 'Find that safe place'")

print("\n2. CURRENT FIELD BRAIN CAPABILITIES:")
print("-" * 50)

print("\n   a) MEMORY OF EXPERIENCES:")
print("      - Topology regions store field patterns")
print("      - Each region links sensory patterns to field states")
print("      - Can recognize 'I've been here before'")

print("\n   b) EMOTIONAL/ENERGY DIMENSIONS:")
print("      - motor_energy: Available motor energy")
print("      - cognitive_energy: Available cognitive resources") 
print("      - sensory_intensity: Overall sensory activation")
print("      - emotional_intensity: Emotional activation level")
print("      → These could encode 'desire' or 'need'")

print("\n   c) EMERGENCE DIMENSIONS:")
print("      - novelty_potential: Potential for novel patterns")
print("      - creativity_space: Creative combination space")
print("      - problem_solving_phase: Problem-solving phase state")
print("      → These support abstract thinking")

print("\n   SCENARIO: 'Find food' as abstract goal")
print("   1. Previous experience: Low energy + found food = high reward")
print("   2. Topology region forms linking:")
print("      - Sensory pattern (smell, visual)")
print("      - Emotional state (satisfaction)")
print("      - Energy increase")
print("   3. When energy low again:")
print("      - Field seeks similar topology")
print("      - Gradients form toward remembered pattern")
print("      - Robot moves seeking that experience")

print("\n   The goal isn't 'go to X,Y' but 'recreate this field state'")

print("\n4. WHAT'S ACTUALLY MISSING:")
print("-" * 50)

print("\n   ✗ DRIVE/MOTIVATION SYSTEM:")
print("      - No internal drives (hunger, curiosity, safety)")
print("      - Energy dimensions exist but don't create pressure")
print("      - No homeostatic regulation")

print("\n   ✗ REWARD LEARNING:")
print("      - No mechanism to mark 'good' vs 'bad' states")
print("      - Topology regions form but have no valence")
print("      - Constraint system learns patterns but not values")

print("\n   ✗ TEMPORAL ABSTRACTION:")
print("      - Can't project future states")
print("      - Can't chain memories into plans")
print("      - Lives in eternal 'now'")

print("   1. DRIVE FIELDS: Energy dimensions create pressure")
print("      Low motor_energy → Seek high-energy memories")

print("      Positive experiences → Stronger topology")
print("   ")
print("   3. FIELD RESONANCE: Current state seeks similar past states")
print("      'Hungry' field seeks 'fed' field patterns")

print("\n6. BIOLOGICAL PARALLEL:")
print("-" * 50)
print("   Real brains don't have coordinate systems either!")
print("   They have:")
print("   - Drives/needs creating pressure")
print("   - Memories of satisfying those needs")
print("   - Pattern matching to find similar situations")
print("   - Motor programs to recreate good states")

print("\n7. CONCLUSION:")
print("-" * 50)
print("   The field brain architecture DOES support abstract goals!")
print("   ")
print("   What's missing is:")
print("   1. Internal drive dynamics (hunger, curiosity)")
print("   2. Reward marking of topology regions")
print("   3. Field resonance seeking valued states")
print("   ")
print("   This is much deeper than just 'goal coordinates'.")
print("   It's about the field having DESIRES and MEMORIES.")
