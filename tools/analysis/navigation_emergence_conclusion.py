print("FINDINGS FROM INVESTIGATION:")
print("-" * 50)

print("\n1. WHAT'S WORKING:")
print("   ✓ Spatial representation exists (5D: x,y,z,scale,time)")
print("   ✓ Memory formation works (topology regions)")
print("   ✓ Sensory-to-field mapping exists")
print("   ✓ Field-to-action mapping exists (gradients → motors)")
print("   ✓ Field evolution and dynamics are active")

print("\n2. WHAT'S MISSING FOR NAVIGATION:")
print("   ✗ Goal representation: No mechanism to encode targets")
print("   ✗ Value propagation: No way to spread goal value through field")
print("   ✗ Spatial resolution: Positions map to same field indices")
print("   ✗ Temporal planning: No anticipation of future states")

print("\n3. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS:")
print("   The field brain architecture is based on continuous fields")
print("   where intelligence emerges from topology optimization.")
print("   ")
print("   For navigation to emerge, we need:")
print("   a) A 'value field' that propagates from goals")
print("   b) Spatial gradients that guide movement")
print("   c) Temporal coherence for path planning")

print("\n4. CURRENT LIMITATION:")
print("   The sensory input (24D) includes only immediate sensors,")
print("   not goal information. Without goal encoding, the field")
print("   cannot create attraction basins for navigation.")

print("\n5. RECOMMENDATION:")
print("-" * 50)
print("   Navigation SHOULD be emergent, but requires:")
print("   ")
print("   OPTION A: Enrich sensory input")
print("   - Add goal direction/distance to sensor array")
print("   - Let field learn goal-seeking naturally")
print("   ")
print("   OPTION B: Add value field layer")
print("   - Propagate value from achieved goals")
print("   - Create attraction gradients in field")
print("   ")
print("   OPTION C: Enhance spatial mapping")  
print("   - Increase spatial resolution for finer position encoding")
print("   - Add landmark/place recognition to topology regions")

print("\n6. CONCLUSION:")
print("-" * 50)
print("   Navigation is NOT currently emergent because:")
print("   1. No goal information reaches the field")
print("   2. Spatial resolution is too coarse")
print("   3. No value/reward propagation mechanism")
print("   ")
print("   This is a MISSING CAPABILITY, not a bug.")
print("   The architecture supports it but needs goal encoding.")

print("\n7. BIOLOGICAL ANALOGY:")
print("   Real brains have:")
print("   - Place cells (topology regions ✓)")
print("   - Grid cells (spatial mapping ✓)")
print("   - Goal cells (missing ✗)")
print("   - Reward prediction (missing ✗)")
print("   ")
print("   We have 2/4 components needed for navigation!")
