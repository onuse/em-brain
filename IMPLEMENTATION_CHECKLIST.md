## Critical Undefined Components ❌

### 1. Semantic Grounding
**Problem**: How do frequency patterns gain meaning?
**Need**: Mechanism linking patterns to outcomes/sensors/actions

### 2. Compositional Operations
**Problem**: How do concepts combine?
**Need**: Frequency algebra that preserves meaning

### 3. Stability Control
**Problem**: System could oscillate chaotically
**Need**: Damping/regularization mechanisms

### 4. Sensory Interface
**Problem**: How does raw sensory data become field disturbance?
**Need**: Encoding scheme for different modalities

### 5. Motor Interface
**Problem**: How do field states become actions?
**Need**: Decoding from field to motor commands

### 6. Temporal Coherence
**Problem**: No mechanism for sequential processing
**Need**: Phase chains or temporal binding

### 7. Causal Learning
**Problem**: Can't learn cause-effect relationships
**Need**: Temporal correlation mechanism

## Minimum Viable Implementation

To test the core hypothesis, we need AT MINIMUM:

1. **Basic Field with Constraints**
```python
class MinimalConstrainedField:
    def __init__(self):
        self.field = torch.randn(32, 32, 32, 64).cuda()
        self.memory_limit = 8  # Severe constraint
        self.energy_budget = 100
```

2. **Compression Mechanism**
```python
def compress(self, field):
    spectrum = torch.fft.fftn(field)
    top_k = torch.topk(spectrum.flatten(), self.memory_limit)
    # This is abstraction
```

3. **Discomfort Measure**
```python
def discomfort(self, field):
    # Your original mechanism
    uniformity = field.var()
    return 1.0 / (1.0 + uniformity)
```

4. **Simple Task Interface**
```python
def task_interface(self):
    # Minimal: Navigate to reduce discomfort
    # Input: Distance to comfort source
    # Output: Movement direction
```

## Implementation Readiness: 60%

### Ready to Implement

## Recommendation

We have enough to build a **proof of concept** but not a complete intelligence:

1. **Build Minimal Version**: Just field + constraints + discomfort
2. **Test Core Hypothesis**: Does compression create abstraction?
3. **Iterate on Gaps**: Add semantic grounding based on what emerges
4. **Scale If Successful**: Only scale what works

The philosophy is complete. The engineering is 60% complete. The unknown 40% might be discovered through experimentation rather than planning.
