# Architecture Updates (July 2025)

## Recent Optimizations

### 1. Local Gradient Optimization
- **Performance**: 50x faster gradient computation (1000ms → 20ms)
- **Method**: Computes gradients only in 3x3x3 local region around robot
- **Benefit**: Maintains full field structure for future distributed actuators
- **Result**: Real-time operation at 30+ Hz

### 2. Hardware-Adaptive Resolution
- **Automatic Selection**: Brain now adapts spatial resolution to hardware
  - High Performance (≤20ms): 5³ resolution for best behaviors
  - Medium Performance (≤40ms): 4³ resolution for balance
  - Low Performance (>40ms): 3³ resolution for speed
- **Implementation**: Integrated with `hardware_adaptation.py`
- **Benefit**: Optimal performance on any hardware without manual config

### 3. Behavioral Parameter Tuning
- **Gradient Following**: Increased from 5.0 to 15.0 (balanced to avoid saturation)
- **Obstacle Detection**: Enhanced with nonlinear response for close obstacles
- **Field Decay**: Reduced to 0.999 for stronger persistent behaviors
- **Result**: 27x stronger behavioral responses

## Known Issues & Feature Gaps

### 1. Disabled Systems
- **Persistence**: Currently disabled (`brain_factory.py:75`)
  - TODO: Re-enable after consolidation cleanup
- **Constraint System**: Temporarily disabled (`core_brain.py:888`)
  - TODO: Fix dimension mismatch for high-dimensional fields

### 2. Memory Formation
- **Issue**: Topology regions not updating properly at resolution 3³
- **Works**: At resolution 5³ with proper warmup
- **TODO**: Investigate threshold sensitivity

### 3. Navigation Optimization
- **Current**: Basic gradient following works
- **Missing**: Path planning, obstacle memory, goal seeking
- **TODO**: Implement higher-level navigation behaviors

### 4. Incomplete Features
- **Multi-actuator support**: Framework exists but not tested
- **Distributed processing**: Local gradients ready but not multi-region
- **Learning algorithms**: Field evolution works but no explicit learning

## Performance Summary

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Gradient Computation | 1014ms | 20ms | 50x |
| Total Cycle Time | 1700ms | 32ms | 53x |
| Frequency (3³) | 0.6 Hz | 31 Hz | 52x |
| Motor Output Range | ~0.006 | ~0.3-1.0 | Normalized |
| Obstacle Response | Weak | Working | Functional |
| Turning Behavior | ~0.018 | ~0.48 | 27x |

## Architecture Recommendations

1. **Fix Constraint System**: The N-dimensional constraint system needs proper index handling
2. **Re-enable Persistence**: After verifying memory cleanup is complete
3. **Enhance Navigation**: Add goal-seeking and path planning layers
4. **Test Multi-Robot**: The architecture supports it but needs validation
5. **GPU Optimization**: Currently CPU-only due to MPS 16D limit
