# TODO Progress Summary

## Completed Today

### 1. âœ… Predictive Sensory Gating
- Implemented biological attention through prediction error
- Brain now modulates imprint strength based on surprise
- Reduced information overload from 9-10 to 0.05 (200x reduction!)

### 2. âœ… Learning-Driven Exploration
- Replaced engineered exploration bursts with emergent mechanism
- Exploration increases when prediction improvement plateaus
- Added metabolic baseline (0.1) for continuous spontaneous activity
- No more arbitrary schedules - exploration emerges from learning addiction

### 3. âœ… Fixed Surprise Detection Lag
- Now compares incoming sensory input against predicted sensory
- Generates sensory predictions based on dominant patterns
- More responsive to novel inputs

### 4. âœ… Lower Initial Field Values
- Changed from scale=0.3, bias=0.1 to scale=0.1, bias=0.0
- Brain starts with low information content
- Cleaner initial state

### 5. âœ… Reduced Motor Cortex Logging
- Changed from every 100 to every 1000 cycles
- Less spam in long-running tests

### 6. ðŸš§ Energy â†’ Information Refactor (In Progress)
- Added field_information() function
- Deprecated field_energy() (calls field_information internally)
- Updated field_stats to include both for compatibility

## Still TODO

### High Priority
- [ ] Complete energy â†’ information refactor throughout codebase
- [ ] Replace fixed thresholds with emergent/dynamic values

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Add more dynamic behavior transitions
- [ ] Implement working memory growth mechanism
- [ ] Create automated test runner for CI/CD

## Key Improvements in Latest Test

The 0.5 hour test showed dramatic improvements:
- **Information levels**: 0.04-0.056 (was 9-10)
- **Learning**: Efficiency improved 0.817 â†’ 0.870 â†’ 0.906
- **Consistent exploration**: Brain explores throughout
- **No performance degradation**: Smooth operation

The brain is finally working as intended!
