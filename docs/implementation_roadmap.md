### Validation Tests
```python

    # Create experience nodes
    node1 = ExperienceNode(mental_context=[1,2,3], action_taken={'motor_0': 0.5})
    node2 = ExperienceNode(mental_context=[1,2,4], action_taken={'motor_0': 0.6})
    
    # Add to graph
    graph = WorldGraph()
    id1 = graph.add_node(node1)
    id2 = graph.add_node(node2)
    
    # Test similarity search
    similar = graph.find_similar_nodes([1,2,3.5], similarity_threshold=0.7)
    assert len(similar) >= 1
