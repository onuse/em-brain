# Prediction Improvement Addiction System Roadmap

## Overview
Transform the existing prediction addiction infrastructure into a fully functional intrinsic motivation system that drives curiosity, learning, and abstract goal formation.

## Phase 1: Basic Predictive Processing (Foundation)

### 1.1 Sensory Prediction Mechanism
- [ ] Implement next-state prediction using temporal field dynamics
- [ ] Store predictions in field for comparison on next cycle
- [ ] Use existing temporal dimensions (oscillatory, flow) for prediction
- [ ] Integration point: `core_brain.py` â†’ `process_robot_cycle()`

### 1.2 Prediction Error Calculation
- [ ] Compare predicted vs actual sensory input each cycle
- [ ] Calculate prediction error as field difference
- [ ] Replace gradient-based confidence with accuracy-based confidence
- [ ] Track prediction accuracy history (replace current pseudo-tracking)

### 1.3 Field-Based Prediction Storage
- [ ] Use topology regions to store prediction patterns
- [ ] Link predictions to actions that generated them
- [ ] Enable prediction replay for planning

## Phase 2: Reward Integration (Value Learning)

### 2.1 External Reward Channel
- [ ] Add reward signal to 24D sensory input (dimension 25)
- [ ] Create reward field dimension in 37D space
- [ ] Propagate reward through field topology

### 2.2 Reward Prediction Error
- [ ] Predict future rewards based on current state
- [ ] Calculate reward prediction error (dopamine analog)
- [ ] Modulate learning rate based on RPE magnitude

### 2.3 Value Field Formation
- [ ] Create persistent value gradients in field
- [ ] Link high-value topology regions
- [ ] Enable value-based action selection

## Phase 3: Temporal Abstraction (Planning)

### 3.1 Multi-Step Prediction
- [ ] Chain predictions across multiple time steps
- [ ] Use temporal field dynamics for sequence learning
- [ ] Create prediction trees in field space

### 3.2 Abstract State Representation
- [ ] Compress sensory predictions into abstract states
- [ ] Use emergence dimensions for abstraction
- [ ] Enable state-based rather than sensory-based predictions

### 3.3 Hierarchical Temporal Planning
- [ ] Short-term predictions (1-5 cycles) in oscillatory dimensions
- [ ] Medium-term plans (10-50 cycles) in flow dimensions
- [ ] Long-term goals (100+ cycles) in topology dimensions

## Phase 4: Goal Emergence (Abstract Motivation)

### 4.1 Drive Field Dynamics
- [ ] Implement homeostatic drives in energy dimensions
- [ ] Create drive pressure that influences field evolution
- [ ] Link drive satisfaction to reward signals

### 4.2 Goal State Representation
- [ ] Encode desired field states as attractors
- [ ] Use coupling dimensions to bind goal components
- [ ] Enable goal recognition from partial matches

### 4.3 Goal-Directed Navigation
- [ ] Propagate goal gradients through spatial dimensions
- [ ] Enable path planning through value field
- [ ] Support multiple simultaneous goals

## Phase 5: Meta-Learning (Learning to Learn)

### 5.1 Prediction Strategy Adaptation
- [ ] Track which prediction methods work best
- [ ] Adjust prediction parameters based on domain
- [ ] Meta-predict prediction accuracy

### 5.2 Curiosity Modulation
- [ ] Balance exploration vs exploitation dynamically
- [ ] Seek areas of high prediction error (curiosity)
- [ ] Avoid areas of unpredictability (safety)

### 5.3 Abstract Concept Formation
- [ ] Discover invariant patterns across experiences
- [ ] Form reusable prediction templates
- [ ] Enable analogical reasoning through field similarity

## Implementation Strategy

### Priority Order
1. **Phase 1.1-1.2**: Core prediction loop (enables everything else)
2. **Phase 2.1**: External rewards (grounds learning in reality)
3. **Phase 3.1**: Multi-step prediction (enables planning)
4. **Phase 4.1-4.2**: Drive dynamics (creates motivation)
5. **Phases 2.2-2.3, 3.2-3.3, 4.3, 5.1-5.3**: Refinements

### Integration Points
- Minimal changes to existing architecture
- Leverage existing field dimensions
- Build on topology region system
- Extend rather than replace current dynamics

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each prediction component
- Behavioral tests for emergent properties
- Validation studies for learning efficiency
