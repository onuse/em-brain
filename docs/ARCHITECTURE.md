# Field Brain Architecture

## Core Paradigm

This architecture implements continuous field-based intelligence where cognition emerges from the topology and dynamics of a 4D tensor field. The system combines predictive processing with self-modifying dynamics to create a truly autonomous artificial brain.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Field-Native Intelligence
All computation occurs through continuous field dynamics rather than discrete symbolic processing. The brain is a single unified tensor where different cognitive functions emerge from field interactions.

### 2. Prediction as Organization
While not the only principle, prediction serves as a fundamental organizing force:
- The brain continuously predicts future states
- Errors drive learning and reorganization  
- Actions test predictive hypotheses
- Attention follows prediction failures

### 3. Self-Modifying Dynamics
The field encodes its own evolution rules, enabling true meta-learning:
- No fixed hyperparameters
- Regional specialization emerges
- Learning rules adapt through experience
- Open-ended complexity growth

## System Architecture

### Core Systems

#### Unified Field Dynamics
Central system managing field evolution:
- **Energy Dynamics**: Activity level emerges from field state
- **Confidence Tracking**: Prediction accuracy modulates behavior
- **Spontaneous Activity**: Traveling waves maintain coherence
- **Differential Decay**: Creates working memory through temporal persistence

#### Evolved Field Dynamics
Self-modifying evolution encoded in the field:
- **Local Parameters**: Decay rate, diffusion, coupling, plasticity
- **Experience-Driven**: Parameters evolve based on prediction success
- **Regional Specialization**: Different areas develop unique dynamics
- **Meta-Learning**: System improves its ability to learn

#### Predictive Processing Systems

**Phase 1 - Sensory Prediction**:
- TopologyRegions learn sensor-specific predictions
- Confidence emerges from accuracy tracking
- 44% accuracy on predictable patterns

**Phase 2 - Error-Driven Learning**:
- All updates driven by prediction errors
- Self-modification scales with error magnitude (up to 3x)
- High-error regions gain computational priority

**Phase 3 - Hierarchical Timescales**:
- Immediate predictions (next cycle)
- Short-term patterns (~10 cycles, 97% accuracy)
- Long-term trends (~100 cycles)
- Abstract invariants (timeless patterns)

**Phase 4 - Predictive Actions**:
- Generate action candidates
- Preview outcomes through simulation
- Select based on value + uncertainty
- Learn from prediction errors

**Phase 5 - Active Sensing**:
- Generate uncertainty maps from confidence
- Direct sensors to maximize information
- Natural behaviors emerge (saccades, pursuit, scanning)
- Modality-agnostic framework

#### Pattern-Based Processing
All operations work with patterns, not coordinates:
- **Pattern Extraction**: Unified system for all modalities
- **Motor Mapping**: Patterns → actions via learned associations
- **Attention**: Salience emerges from novelty + importance
- **Memory**: Stable patterns persist as topology regions

#### Memory and Consolidation
Long-term structure emerges from field dynamics:
- **Topology Regions**: Stable configurations become memories
- **Strategic Patterns**: Behavioral strategies stored in channels 32-47
- **Pattern Library**: Successful patterns accumulate and blend
- **Consolidation**: Important patterns strengthen during rest

#### Intrinsic Drives and Tensions
The field operates through intrinsic tensions that create natural behavior:
- **Information Tension**: Low field energy creates exploration drive
- **Learning Velocity Tension**: Stagnant improvement creates novelty seeking
- **Confidence Tension**: Uncertainty creates need for resolution
- **Prediction Error Tension**: Errors create adaptation pressure
- **Novelty Tension**: Low variance creates need for variation

These tensions aren't external rewards but emergent properties of the field seeking equilibrium, like water flowing downhill.

## Information Flow

### Sensory → Field

   - Confidence tension → Stabilizing radial patterns
   - Prediction tension → Corrective wave patterns
   - Novelty tension → Multi-scale variations
3. Patterns evaluated by tension reduction, not external rewards
4. Successful tension-resolving patterns stored in memory channels 32-47
5. Motor behavior emerges naturally from tension-resolving gradients

### Field → Field (Self-Modification)
1. Prediction errors create error gradients
2. High-error regions increase plasticity
3. Successful regions stabilize
4. Evolution parameters update locally

### Cross-Cycle Persistence
