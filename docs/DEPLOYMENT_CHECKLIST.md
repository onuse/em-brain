## 🚀 Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Hardware Integration
- [ ] Test with actual PiCar-X hardware (currently using mock)
- [ ] Verify sensor ranges match documentation
- [ ] Calibrate motor command scaling
- [ ] Test emergency stop functionality

### 2. Brain-Brainstem Communication
- [ ] Deploy brain server on suitable hardware
- [ ] Configure network settings (currently localhost:8000)
- [ ] Test latency over network (target < 50ms round trip)
- [ ] Implement connection retry logic

### 3. Safety Validation
- [ ] Test collision avoidance reflex with real ultrasonic sensor
- [ ] Verify cliff detection works reliably
- [ ] Test battery monitoring and low-power behavior
- [ ] Validate temperature throttling

### 4. Performance Tuning
- [ ] Adjust motor smoothing factor based on robot response
- [ ] Tune reward signal parameters for desired behavior
- [ ] Optimize brain cycle rate vs. robot control rate
- [ ] Profile CPU usage on Raspberry Pi Zero 2

## ⚠️ Key Considerations

### Motor Command Scaling
The brain outputs are in range [-0.2, 0.5] typically. The brainstem scales these to motor percentages, but you may need to adjust:
```python
self.max_motor_speed = 50.0  # Adjust based on robot behavior
self.max_steering_angle = 25.0  # May need tuning
```

### Sensor Normalization
Current mapping assumes:
- Ultrasonic: 0-4 meters
- Grayscale: 0-1 (already normalized)
- Battery: 0-8.4V

Verify these match your actual hardware.

### Network Architecture
Current setup assumes brain server and robot on same network. For remote operation:
1. Use secure tunnel (VPN/SSH)
2. Implement authentication (API key in headers)
3. Add encryption for sensor data
4. Handle network failures gracefully

### Resource Constraints
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 has limited resources:
- 512MB RAM
- Quad-core 1GHz ARM
- Consider running brain server on more powerful hardware

## 📊 Testing Protocol

### Phase 1: Bench Testing
1. Connect PiCar-X to brain server over local network
2. Run stationary tests (motors disabled)
3. Verify sensor data flow and normalization
4. Check motor command generation

### Phase 2: Controlled Environment
1. Clear, flat surface with boundaries
2. Test basic navigation and obstacle avoidance
3. Verify line following behavior
4. Monitor for oscillations or instability

### Phase 3: Real-World Testing
1. Varied surfaces and lighting
2. Dynamic obstacles
3. Battery depletion scenarios
4. Network interruption handling

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Brain Server (`server/settings.json`)
```json
{
  "brain": {
    "type": "dynamic_unified_field",
    "use_full_features": true,
    "device": "cuda"  // or "cpu" for testing
  },
  "api": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 8000
  }
}
```

### PiCar-X Client (`client_picarx/config/client_settings.json`)
Update with your brain server address:
```json
{
  "brain_server": {
    "host": "brain-server-ip",
    "port": 8000,
    "api_key": "your-secure-key"
  }
}
```

## 📝 Monitoring

During deployment, monitor:
1. Brain cycle time (target < 50ms)
2. Network latency
3. Reflex activation frequency
4. Motor command ranges
5. CPU temperature on both devices
6. Memory usage trends

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The system is ready for deployment when:
1. Robot responds to obstacles within 100ms
2. Smooth motor control without oscillations
3. Graceful handling of brain server disconnection
4. Battery life > 30 minutes active operation
5. No thermal throttling under normal use

Remember: Start with conservative motor speeds and gradually increase as you validate behavior!
