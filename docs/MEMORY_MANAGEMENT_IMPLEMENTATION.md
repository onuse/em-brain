# Memory Management and Cache Coordination Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive memory management and intelligent cache coordination system implemented to prevent unbounded memory growth in the brain architecture. The system ensures the brain can run indefinitely without memory issues while maintaining performance.

## Problem Statement

The diagnostic showed that multiple cache systems across the brain were growing without bounds:

- **SimilarityEngine cache** - Simple dictionary with FIFO eviction, fixed at 1000 entries
- **ActivationDynamics similarity cache** - No bounds, growing without limits  
- **GPU similarity cache** - No bounds in optimized dynamics
- **Pattern analysis cache** - Some age-based eviction but no size bounds
- **Stream storage** - Some components had bounds, others didn't
- **Tensor cache** - Limited cache but no coordination

Without proper memory management, these caches could grow indefinitely, eventually causing memory exhaustion and system crashes.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Unified Memory Manager (`memory_manager.py`)

The core component that coordinates all cache systems and monitors system memory:

**Key Features:**
- Global memory monitoring and bounds checking
- Coordinated cache cleanup based on priority
- Memory pressure detection and automatic response
- Background monitoring with configurable intervals
- Emergency cleanup procedures for critical memory situations

**Configuration:**
- `max_total_cache_memory_mb`: Total memory budget for all caches (default: 500MB)
- `memory_pressure_threshold`: System memory pressure threshold (default: 0.8)
- `emergency_cleanup_threshold`: Critical memory threshold (default: 0.95)
- `monitoring_interval`: Background monitoring frequency (default: 30s)

### 2. Intelligent Cache System (`IntelligentCache`)

A sophisticated cache implementation with multiple eviction strategies:

**Eviction Policies:**
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Evicts oldest unaccessed items
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Evicts least frequently accessed items  
- **Utility-Based**: Evicts items with lowest prediction utility scores
- **Hybrid**: Combines age, frequency, and utility for optimal decisions
- **Random**: Baseline random eviction for comparison

**Features:**
- Memory size tracking and bounds enforcement
- Access pattern monitoring (frequency, recency)
- Utility score tracking for intelligent decisions
- Thread-safe operations with locks
- Comprehensive statistics and performance metrics

### 3. Cache Adapters (`cache_adapters.py`)

Adapter classes that integrate existing cache implementations with the memory manager:

#### SimilarityEngineCacheAdapter
- Wraps SimilarityEngine's simple dictionary cache
- Provides memory bounds and intelligent eviction
- Maintains API compatibility for seamless migration
- Tracks cache hit/miss statistics

#### ActivationCacheAdapter  
- Manages similarity caches and GPU tensor data
- Separate caches for similarity relationships and GPU tensors
- Utility-based eviction prioritizing high-activation experiences
- Coordinated cleanup across both cache types

#### PatternCacheAdapter
- Manages pattern analysis results with time-based expiration
- Age-based cleanup combined with memory-based eviction
- Configurable maximum age for pattern validity
- Hybrid eviction considering both age and utility

#### StreamBufferAdapter
- Bounded stream storage with efficient circular buffering
- LRU eviction for temporal data streams
- Sequential key generation for ordering
- Efficient recent data retrieval

### 4. Integration with Existing Systems

#### SimilarityEngine Integration
```python
# Before: Simple dictionary with manual eviction
self._cache = {}
self._max_cache_size = 1000

# After: Memory-managed intelligent cache
self._cache = SimilarityEngineCacheAdapter(
    max_entries=1000,
    max_size_mb=50.0,
    eviction_policy="hybrid"
)
```

#### ActivationDynamics Integration  
```python
# Before: Unbounded similarity cache
self._similarity_cache = {}

# After: Memory-managed cache with utility tracking
self._cache_adapter = ActivationCacheAdapter(
    max_entries=2000,
    max_size_mb=100.0,
    eviction_policy="utility_based"
)
```

#### PredictionEngine Integration
```python
# Before: Simple pattern cache with manual cleanup
self.pattern_cache = {}

# After: Memory-managed cache with time-based expiration
self.pattern_cache = PatternCacheAdapter(
    max_entries=500,
    max_size_mb=75.0,
    max_age_seconds=30.0,
    eviction_policy="hybrid"
)
```

## Memory Coordination Strategy

### Priority-Based Cleanup
Caches are assigned priorities to determine cleanup order:
- **High Priority (3.0)**: SimilarityEngine cache - critical for performance
- **Medium-High Priority (1.8)**: GPU tensor cache - expensive to recompute
- **Medium Priority (1.5)**: Activation similarity cache - important for spreading
- **Low Priority (1.0)**: Pattern cache, stream buffers - can be regenerated

### Cleanup Triggers
Memory cleanup is triggered by:
1. **System Memory Pressure**: When system RAM usage exceeds threshold
2. **Cache Memory Limits**: When total cache memory exceeds budget
3. **Individual Cache Limits**: When a cache exceeds its own limits
4. **Emergency Conditions**: When system memory is critically low

### Cleanup Strategy
1. **Target Calculation**: Determine how much memory to free
2. **Priority Sorting**: Sort caches by priority (lowest cleaned first)
3. **Proportional Cleanup**: Clean each cache proportionally to its size
4. **Utility Preservation**: Within each cache, preserve high-utility items
5. **Validation**: Verify memory reduction achieved

## Performance Benefits

### Memory Bounds
- **Before**: Unbounded growth, potential memory exhaustion
- **After**: Guaranteed memory limits, indefinite operation

### Intelligent Eviction
- **Before**: Simple FIFO or random eviction
- **After**: Utility-based eviction preserving valuable data

### Coordinated Management
- **Before**: Independent caches competing for memory
- **After**: Coordinated cleanup respecting system-wide limits

### Monitoring and Adaptation
- **Before**: No memory monitoring, reactive cleanup
- **After**: Proactive monitoring, automatic adaptation

## Testing and Validation

- System integration with existing brain components

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Managed Cache
```python
from server.src.utils.memory_manager import create_managed_cache, CacheType, EvictionPolicy

cache = create_managed_cache(
    name="my_cache",
    cache_type=CacheType.GENERAL,
    max_entries=1000,
    max_size_mb=50.0,
    eviction_policy=EvictionPolicy.HYBRID,
    priority=2.0
)
```

### Manual Memory Cleanup
```python
from server.src.utils.memory_manager import get_memory_manager

memory_manager = get_memory_manager()
cleaned = memory_manager.cleanup_caches(target_reduction_mb=100.0)
print(f"Cleaned entries: {cleaned}")
```

### Memory Statistics
```python
stats = memory_manager.get_comprehensive_stats()
print(f"Total cache memory: {stats['memory_stats'].cache_memory_usage_mb:.1f}MB")
print(f"System memory pressure: {stats['memory_stats'].memory_pressure:.1%}")
```

    memory_pressure_threshold=0.8,      # System pressure threshold
    emergency_cleanup_threshold=0.95,   # Emergency threshold
    monitoring_interval=30.0            # Monitoring frequency
