# TODO: Field-Native Intelligence System

## Current Focus: Hardware Deployment

The dynamic brain is now generating motor outputs successfully! Motor generation issue (exploration score 0.00) has been fixed. The system is ready for real robot testing.

### Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] Deploy brain server with actual PiCar-X hardware
- [ ] Test and calibrate sensor normalization ranges
- [ ] Validate motor command scaling on real motors
- [ ] Test network latency between brain server and robot

### High Priority
- [ ] Verify ultrasonic sensor range mapping (currently assumes 0-4m)
- [ ] Test safety reflexes with real sensor data
- [ ] Implement connection retry logic for network failures
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for Raspberry Pi Zero 2

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Tune reward signal parameters based on robot behavior
- [ ] Optimize motor smoothing factor
- [ ] Implement secure API authentication
- [ ] Add real-time field visualization dashboard

### Low Priority
- [ ] Document sensor-to-brain mapping algorithm
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for different surfaces
- [ ] Add support for multiple robot connections
- [ ] Implement predictive maintenance alerts

### Completed Recently
- [x] Fixed motor generation (gradient key mismatch bug)
- [x] Fixed field activation strength (was too weak)
- [x] Fixed sensory-to-field coordinate mapping
- [x] Implemented complete brainstem layer with:
  - [x] 16→24 sensor channel expansion
  - [x] 4→5 motor channel mapping
  - [x] Reward signal generation
  - [x] Safety reflexes and fallback behaviors
- [x] Validated 40ms cycle time (suitable for 25Hz control)
- [x] Created integrated brainstem with HTTP communication
- [x] Added deployment checklist documentation

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Dynamic Brain Creation**: Brains created on-demand with logarithmic dimension scaling
2. **Robot Profiles**: JSON-based profiles define robot capabilities
3. **Brain Pooling**: Reuse brain instances for efficiency
4. **Adapter Pattern**: Clean translation between robot and brain spaces
5. **Maintenance Automation**: Background scheduler keeps brains healthy

## Next Major Milestone

Deploy and test the brain server with actual PiCar-X hardware to validate real-world performance and latency characteristics.
