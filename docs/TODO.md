# Emergence Optimization TODO

## The Hardcoded Threshold Challenge

**Current Status**: The brain implements sophisticated emergence across 5 major strategies, but still contains ~100+ hardcoded thresholds that could theoretically be made adaptive.

**Key Question**: Which thresholds are fundamental constraints vs which represent missed opportunities for emergence?

---

## High-Priority Adaptive Threshold Candidates

### **1. Activation System Thresholds** (`activation/dynamics.py`, `activation/utility_based_activation.py`)

**Core Decay & Spread Parameters**:
- `decay_rate = 0.02` - Could adapt based on memory effectiveness
- `spread_strength = 0.1` - Could adapt based on learning success
- `activation_threshold = 0.1` - Could be percentile-based instead of absolute
- `working_memory_threshold = 0.1` - Could adapt to cognitive load

**Success Criteria**: Parameters that optimize working memory size vs prediction accuracy

### **2. Similarity System Thresholds** (`similarity/engine.py`, `similarity/learnable_similarity.py`)

**Critical Similarity Boundaries**:
- `min_similarity = 0.3` (used everywhere) - Could be adaptive percentile (e.g., top 20%)
- `correlation_threshold = 0.3` - Could adapt based on data quality
- `similarity_boost_threshold = 0.7` - Could be relative to current distribution
- `learning_rate_bounds = (0.001, 0.1)` - Could be unbounded with smart regularization

**Success Criteria**: Similarity function that maximizes prediction accuracy without overfitting

### **3. Prediction System Thresholds** (`prediction/engine.py`)

**Decision Boundaries**:
- `min_similar_experiences = 3` - Could adapt based on confidence requirements
- `confidence_threshold = 0.3` - Could adapt based on risk tolerance
- `bootstrap_noise_level = 0.1` - Could decrease as learning progresses
- `consensus_threshold = 0.5` - Could be majority-based rather than fixed

**Success Criteria**: Optimal balance of exploration vs exploitation

### **4. Pattern Discovery Thresholds** (`stream/pattern_discovery.py`)

**Emergence Detection**:
- `error_change_threshold = 0.5` - Could adapt based on noise levels
- `pattern_strength_threshold = 1.0` - Could be relative to baseline
- `motif_similarity_threshold = 0.3` - Could adapt to pattern complexity
- `emergence_threshold = 0.7` - Could be self-calibrating

**Success Criteria**: Earlier and more accurate pattern detection

## Meta-Learning Opportunities

### **Strategy 5 Extension: Meta-Meta-Learning**

**Current State**: Many systems have adaptive learning rates, but the adaptation rates themselves are fixed.

**Next Level**:
- Adaptation rates that adapt based on adaptation success
- Cross-system parameter coordination
- Global optimization of the entire parameter landscape

### **Distribution-Based Thresholds**

**Current Problem**: Absolute thresholds (like "activation > 0.8") break when scales change.

**Emergence Target**: 
- Percentile-based thresholds (e.g., "top 10% activation")
- Self-normalizing parameters
- Adaptive scaling based on system state

## The "Irreducible Cognitive Architecture" Question

### **Refined Mission**: 
*Prove that 4 adaptive systems + 1 primary drive constitute the minimal computational substrate for intelligence*

### **Scientific Hypothesis**:
These 4 systems are **computationally irreducible** - you cannot build intelligence with fewer fundamental mechanisms:
1. **Experience Storage**: Information persistence (irreducible - need memory)
2. **Similarity Search**: Pattern matching (irreducible - need comparison)  
3. **Activation Dynamics**: Attention/working memory (irreducible - need selection)
4. **Prediction Engine**: Action generation (irreducible - need decision)

### **Key Questions**:
- Are these 4 systems truly minimal, or could 3 suffice?
- Can unlimited behavioral complexity emerge from just these mechanisms?
- How adaptive can we make the system while preserving the architecture?
- Does this architecture scale to human-level intelligence?

### **Success Criteria**:
- System exhibits sophisticated behaviors not explicitly programmed
- Architecture transfers across different robotic platforms
- Performance scales with experience rather than hand-tuning
- Emergent capabilities surprise even the developers

## Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: High-Impact Thresholds** 
Focus on the 10-15 thresholds that most directly affect intelligence:
- [ ] Make similarity thresholds percentile-based instead of absolute
- [ ] Adaptive activation decay based on memory effectiveness
- [ ] Context-sensitive confidence thresholds
- [ ] Self-calibrating pattern emergence detection

### **Phase 2: Cross-System Coordination**
- [ ] Global parameter optimization based on prediction accuracy
- [ ] Cross-system adaptation (similarity learning affects activation parameters)
- [ ] Holistic performance measures that guide all subsystems

### **Phase 3: Minimal Architecture Validation**
Test the "irreducible cognitive architecture" hypothesis:
- [ ] Attempt to build intelligence with only 3 systems (remove one)
- [ ] Test if architecture transfers to completely different domains
- [ ] Measure emergence ceiling - what's the most sophisticated behavior possible?
- [ ] Compare against specialized AI systems in same domains

---

## Success Metrics

### **Quantitative**:
- Reduction in hardcoded parameters (currently ~100+)
- Improvement in adaptation speed and accuracy
- Better generalization across different environments

### **Qualitative**:
- System behavior that surprises even the developers
- Emergent capabilities not explicitly programmed
- Robust performance without parameter tuning

### **The Ultimate Test**:
Does this 4-system architecture represent the minimal computational substrate for intelligence, or can sophisticated cognition emerge from even simpler foundations?

## Scientific Framework

**Core Insight**: Intelligence requires both **computational irreducibility** (you need certain mechanisms) and **behavioral emergence** (complex behaviors from simple interactions).

**The Sweet Spot**:
- **Minimal Mechanisms**: 4 systems is the fewest that can support intelligence
- **Maximal Emergence**: All behaviors emerge from system interactions
- **Scientific Rigor**: Testable hypotheses about what's fundamental vs emergent
- **Practical Effectiveness**: System actually works for real robots

**Research Strategy**: Focus on making the 4 systems maximally adaptive and general, rather than seeking to eliminate them entirely.

---

## Current Priority

**Immediate Focus**: Phase 1 - Implement adaptive thresholds for the 10-15 most critical parameters. This will validate whether additional emergence meaningfully improves performance before tackling the deeper philosophical questions.

**Timeline**: Expect months of patient experimentation as truly adaptive systems slowly bootstrap themselves.

**Success Criterion**: System that continuously surprises us with capabilities we didn't explicitly design.
