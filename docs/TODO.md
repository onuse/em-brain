# TODO: Field-Native Intelligence System

## Current Focus: Real-World Testing

The dynamic brain architecture is now fully implemented and operational. Brains are created on-demand based on robot capabilities, with optimal field dimensions calculated algorithmically.

### High Priority
- [ ] Test brain with real PiCar-X sensor noise patterns
- [ ] Implement safety reflex layer on Pi Zero for obstacle avoidance  
- [ ] Test network latency between Mac and Pi

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Improve field activation spreading
- [ ] Optimize brain pool for resource management
- [ ] Enhance monitoring dashboard with real-time field visualization

### Low Priority
- [ ] Document brain dimension calculation algorithm
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for different robot profiles
- [ ] Add support for runtime brain reconfiguration

### Completed Recently
- [x] Implemented full dynamic brain architecture
- [x] Created lazy brain initialization system
- [x] Built robot profile registry and management
- [x] Added brain instance pooling for efficiency
- [x] Implemented automatic maintenance scheduler
- [x] Enhanced error handling with standardized codes
- [x] Cleaned up server directory structure
- [x] Renamed server entry point to brain.py
- [x] Migrated all components to new architecture
- [x] Fixed dimension reporting for dynamic brains
- [x] Added system information display on startup

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Dynamic Brain Creation**: Brains created on-demand with logarithmic dimension scaling
2. **Robot Profiles**: JSON-based profiles define robot capabilities
3. **Brain Pooling**: Reuse brain instances for efficiency
4. **Adapter Pattern**: Clean translation between robot and brain spaces
5. **Maintenance Automation**: Background scheduler keeps brains healthy

## Next Major Milestone

Deploy and test the brain server with actual PiCar-X hardware to validate real-world performance and latency characteristics.
