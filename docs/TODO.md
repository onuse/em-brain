## Next Steps Priority

Based on our philosophy of "complexity emerges, not engineered":

1. **Advanced Learning** - Add consolidation and dreams for intelligence growth
2. **Improved Persistence** - Enable long-running experiments and distributed learning
3. **Robot Platform Integration** - Deploy optimized brain to real hardware

The current architecture is clean, powerful, and fast (1.77x speedup achieved). Further improvements should maintain this simplicity while enhancing emergent capabilities.

## Performance Notes

- Baseline cycle time: 325ms → Optimized: 183ms (1.77x speedup)
- Pattern extraction: 82ms → 50ms with caching
- Batch processing ready for multi-robot scenarios
- Use `SimplifiedUnifiedBrain(use_optimized=True)` for best performance
- Disable predictive actions for additional speed: `brain.enable_predictive_actions(False)`
