# PiCar-X Brain Project TODO

## High-Fidelity 3D Demo Implementation

### Phase 1: Core 3D Infrastructure
- [ ] Research and select 3D graphics library (Pygame + ModernGL/PyOpenGL)
- [ ] Create basic 3D scene setup (camera, lighting, coordinate system)
- [ ] Implement mouse orbit camera controls (zoom, pan, rotate)
- [ ] Test 3D rendering performance with real-time updates

### Phase 2: Basic Scene Components
- [ ] Create simple room environment (walls, floor with grid)
- [ ] Add basic robot representation (rectangular chassis)
- [ ] Implement obstacle rendering (cylinders/boxes)
- [ ] Add direction indicator for robot (arrow/cone)

### Phase 3: Brain Integration
- [ ] Connect 3D scene to existing PiCarXBrainstem
- [ ] Real-time position/rotation updates from brain state
- [ ] Integrate with existing control cycle timing
- [ ] Verify consistency with test_demo and demo_2d

### Phase 4: Sensor Visualization
- [ ] Render ultrasonic sensor beam (translucent cone)
- [ ] Add camera field of view visualization
- [ ] Show line tracking sensor indicators
- [ ] Real-time sensor data updates

### Phase 5: Enhanced Legibility
- [ ] Robot trail visualization (colored ribbon/line)
- [ ] Brain state HUD overlay (experiences, confidence)
- [ ] Performance metrics display (cycle time, collisions)
- [ ] Color-coded robot states (learning/confident/stuck)

### Phase 6: Polish and Features
- [ ] Smooth camera transitions and presets
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (reset view, pause, screenshot)
- [ ] Export/save camera positions
- [ ] Demo recording capabilities

### Technical Requirements
- Engineering visualization style (clean geometry, high contrast)
- Maintain 20+ FPS with brain updates
- Intuitive camera controls for spatial understanding
- Clear visual hierarchy (robot > obstacles > environment)
- Professional appearance suitable for demonstrations

### Success Criteria
- Can observe robot behavior from any angle
- Easy to understand spatial relationships
- Brain state clearly visible during operation
- Provides better insight than 2D version
- Maintains same transfer learning fidelity as other demos
