## Next Steps Priority

Based on our philosophy of "complexity emerges, not engineered":

1. **Pattern System Unification** - Continue simplifying by unifying pattern extraction
2. **Performance Optimization** - Make the simple system fast
3. **Advanced Learning** - Add consolidation and dreams for intelligence growth

The current architecture is clean and powerful. Further improvements should maintain this simplicity while enhancing emergent capabilities.
