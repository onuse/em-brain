# Brain Project TODO

## PRIORITY: Validation System Refinement

**CRITICAL** - Before any hardware deployment or further development, we need scientifically rigorous validation.

### Phase 1: Core Integration Fixes (COMPLETED âœ…)
- [x] **Fix brain server process management** - Server hangs waiting for connections
- [x] **Implement validation_runner_with_server.py** - Proper server/client lifecycle management
- [x] **Resolve import path issues** - Fix validation experiment imports
- [x] **Test basic integration** - 5-minute validation runs to verify functionality
- [x] **Add connection stability** - Survive consolidation breaks

**STATUS: All integration tests pass with 100% success rate. Validation system is ready for use.**

### Phase 2: Scientific Rigor
- [ ] **Add statistical validation** - Confidence intervals, significance testing
- [ ] **Implement control conditions** - Random baseline comparisons
- [ ] **Multiple seed testing** - Reproducibility across random seeds
- [ ] **Learning curve analysis** - Quantify improvement over time
- [ ] **Biological realism metrics** - Consolidation benefits, forgetting curves

### Phase 3: Environment Sophistication
- [ ] **Multi-goal scenarios** - Competing objectives (light vs. battery)
- [ ] **Dynamic environments** - Moving obstacles, changing conditions
- [ ] **Transfer learning tests** - Generalization to new environments
- [ ] **Realistic constraints** - Sensor noise, motor delays, energy limits

**See `validation/TODO_VALIDATION_REFINEMENT.md` for detailed breakdown.**

## Notes

**Current Status**: Validation system framework created but needs integration fixes before use. The embodied Free Energy system is theoretically sound but requires scientific validation before deployment.

**Next Steps**: Focus entirely on Phase 1 validation fixes. No other development until we have working validation system.

**Blocking Issues**: Server-client process management, import path resolution, integration testing.

**Timeline**: Target 1-2 weeks for working validation system, then 2-4 weeks for comprehensive scientific validation.
