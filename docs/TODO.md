# Constraint-Based Intelligence Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement constraint-based emergence where intelligence arises from optimization under physical constraints at massive scale. We leverage evolution's discoveries not by copying mechanisms, but by copying the constraints that shaped those mechanisms.

## Core Philosophy Crystallized
**Principle**: Intelligence emerges from optimization under constraints, not from explicit architectural features
**Method**: Massive GPU parallelism + Physical constraints + Huge data scale = Emergent intelligence
**Strategy**: Find minimal constraint set that produces maximal intelligence emergence at scale
