# Strategy 1 Preparation Checklist

Before implementing Strategy 1 (Pure Information Streams), we need to ensure robust infrastructure to minimize surprise problems.

## Current Issues Found

### 1. Test Compatibility Issues ❌
- `test_minimal_brain.py` expects `working_memory_size` in activation stats but utility-based activation uses different structure
- Need to fix test compatibility with both activation systems

### 2. Missing Development Infrastructure
- [ ] No `requirements.txt` for dependency management  
- [ ] No version pinning for numpy, torch, etc.
- [ ] No development setup documentation

## Infrastructure Improvements Needed

### 1. Fix Test Compatibility ✅ (Priority: High)
- ✅ Updated `test_minimal_brain.py` to work with both activation systems
- ✅ Fixed import path in `test_client_server.py`
- ✅ All core tests now pass (9/11 pass, 2 client-server issues remain)

### 2. Dependency Management ✅ (Priority: High)
- ✅ Created `requirements.txt` with current working versions
- ✅ Pinned major dependencies (numpy==2.3.1, torch==2.7.1)
- ✅ Documented Python version requirement (3.13.5 tested)

### 3. Import Path Standardization (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Create `__init__.py` in root for package imports
- [ ] Consider making package installable with `pip install -e .`
- [ ] Standardize import patterns across all files

### 4. Testing Infrastructure (Priority: Medium) 
- [ ] Add test for Strategy 1 compatibility
- [ ] Create integration test that runs all strategies
- [ ] Add performance regression tests

### 5. Documentation Updates (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Update README with setup instructions
- [ ] Document Strategy 1 architecture before implementation
- [ ] Create migration guide for Strategy 1

## Strategy 1 Specific Preparations

### 1. Interface Compatibility
- [ ] Define common interface for both structured and stream-based storage
- [ ] Create adapter layer for existing similarity/activation systems
- [ ] Plan backward compatibility for existing demos

### 2. Performance Considerations
- [ ] Stream storage will be much larger - prepare for memory management
- [ ] Pattern discovery will be computationally expensive - prepare for optimization
- [ ] Consider need for checkpointing/persistence

### 3. Testing Strategy
- [ ] How to test emergence of experience boundaries?
- [ ] How to validate that discovered structure is meaningful?
- [ ] How to compare performance vs structured approach?

## Success Criteria

Before implementing Strategy 1:
- [ ] All current tests pass
- [ ] Dependencies are documented and pinned
- [ ] Clear interface design for stream storage
- [ ] Performance baseline established
- [ ] Migration path planned

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Loss Risk**: Ensure current structured system remains available
2. **Performance Risk**: Profile current system before changes
3. **Complexity Risk**: Implement in phases with fallbacks
4. **Integration Risk**: Maintain compatibility with existing demos

## Implementation Order

1. Fix immediate test issues
2. Create dependency management
3. Design Strategy 1 interfaces
4. Implement Strategy 1 in parallel with existing system
5. Create comparison tests
6. Gradual migration with fallbacks
