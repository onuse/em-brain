# Phase Transitions vs Cognitive Autopilot

## Overview

Phase transitions and cognitive autopilot are **different but complementary systems** that operate at different levels:

- **Cognitive Autopilot**: Controls computational intensity based on prediction confidence
- **Phase Transitions**: Controls field dynamics based on energy states

## Key Differences

### 1. What They Control

**Cognitive Autopilot**
- Controls how much attention to pay to sensory input
- Adjusts computational intensity (analysis depth)
- Manages sensor gating (20% → 50% → 90% attention)
- Affects working memory adjustment and search depth

**Phase Transitions**
- Controls the field's dynamic behavior patterns
- Changes how the field evolves and self-organizes
- Creates different types of attractors/perturbations
- Manages energy distribution in the field

### 2. Trigger Conditions

**Cognitive Autopilot Modes**
- **AUTOPILOT** (>90% confidence): Familiar situation, cruise control
- **FOCUSED** (70-90% confidence): Moderate uncertainty
- **DEEP_THINK** (<70% confidence): Novel situation, full analysis

**Phase Transition States**
- **stable**: Low energy, low variance - calm, organized field
- **high_energy**: High energy, low variance - intense but controlled
- **chaotic**: High energy, high variance - exploratory, creative
- **low_energy**: Very low energy - needs activation boost

### 3. Biological Analogies

**Cognitive Autopilot**
- Like conscious attention: "Am I paying attention or on autopilot?"
- Familiar route to work = autopilot mode
- Unexpected traffic = focused mode
- Lost in new city = deep think mode

**Phase Transitions**
- Like brain states: calm → excited → chaotic → exhausted
- Meditation = stable phase
- Flow state = high_energy phase
- Creative breakthrough = chaotic phase
- Mental fatigue = low_energy phase

## How They Interact

### Complementary Effects

1. **High Confidence + Stable Phase**
   - Autopilot mode: Low computational effort
   - Stable phase: Organized, efficient field dynamics
   - Result: Maximum efficiency, minimal energy use

2. **Low Confidence + Chaotic Phase**
   - Deep think mode: Maximum analysis
   - Chaotic phase: Exploratory field dynamics
   - Result: Creative problem solving, finding new solutions

3. **High Confidence + Chaotic Phase**
   - Autopilot mode: Still coasting on confidence
   - Chaotic phase: Field is energetic despite confidence
   - Result: Spontaneous creativity while relaxed

4. **Low Confidence + Stable Phase**
   - Deep think mode: Trying hard to understand
   - Stable phase: Field remains organized
   - Result: Methodical analysis of unfamiliar situation

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Robot navigating familiar room**
- Cognitive autopilot: AUTOPILOT (high confidence)
- Phase state: stable (low energy, organized)
- Behavior: Smooth, efficient navigation

**Scenario 2: Robot encounters unexpected obstacle**
- Cognitive autopilot: Shifts to FOCUSED/DEEP_THINK
- Phase state: May shift to high_energy or chaotic
- Behavior: Increased analysis, exploratory movements

**Scenario 3: Robot in completely new environment**
- Cognitive autopilot: DEEP_THINK (low confidence)
- Phase state: Likely chaotic (high variance)
- Behavior: Cautious exploration, learning mode

## Implementation Details

### Cognitive Autopilot
```python
# Based on prediction confidence
if confidence > 0.9:
    mode = AUTOPILOT
    sensor_attention = 0.2  # 20% attention
elif confidence > 0.7:
    mode = FOCUSED
    sensor_attention = 0.5  # 50% attention
else:
    mode = DEEP_THINK
    sensor_attention = 0.9  # 90% attention
```

### Phase Transitions
```python
# Based on field energy and variance
if energy > 0.7:
    if variance < 0.3:
        phase = "high_energy"
    else:
        phase = "chaotic"
elif energy < 0.1:
    phase = "low_energy"
else:
    if variance < 0.3:
        phase = "stable"
```

## Summary

- **Different systems**: Autopilot controls attention, phases control field dynamics
- **Different triggers**: Confidence vs energy/variance
- **Complementary**: Can reinforce or counterbalance each other
- **Both biological**: Mirror real brain processes at different levels

The combination creates rich, adaptive behavior where the brain can be:
- Confident but energetic (autopilot + high_energy)
- Uncertain but stable (deep_think + stable)
- Confident and chaotic (creative flow state)
- Any other combination that emerges naturally
